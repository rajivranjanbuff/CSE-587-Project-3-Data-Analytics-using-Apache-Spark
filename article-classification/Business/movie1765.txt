And if they greenlight the right ones, it may be a small revival of these at the studios and at Oscar time.That said: Who should win best picture: “The Florida Project.” Who will win: “The Shape of Water.”For director, should win: Sean Baker for “The Florida Project.” Will win: Guillermo del Toro for “The Shape of Water.”For actor, should win: Denzel Washington in “Roman J. Israel, Esq.” Will win: Gary Oldman in “Darkest Hour.”For actress, should win: Brooklyn Prince in “The Florida Project.” Will win: Frances McDormand in “Three Billboards.”And for best actress, the award will go to Frances McDormand, who’s so brilliant across the board that I’m thrilled for her. It should go to Margot Robbie. Her last 15 minutes in “I, Tonya” — at the Olympics — are raw screen acting at its most effective.Ross?Frank Bruni and Ross Douthat are Op-Ed columnists for The Times.
