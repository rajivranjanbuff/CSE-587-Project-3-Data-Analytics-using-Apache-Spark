Spread out over eight years, it’s a pardonably large total, especially for two former film actors, a couple who retained show business as a frame of reference long after they’d gone into its professional cousin, politics. All their viewing of the era’s biggest hits probably kept the Reagans more connected to the country than watching four hours a day of cable news.Mark Weinberg, a young press aide detailed to Camp David on the weekends, would join a group of staffers in Aspen Lodge each time the president opened the door just before 8 p.m. Everyone would watch the films, and the staffers would also watch their hosts. More than 30 years later, with the former first lady’s blessing, Weinberg began writing this amiable book about the experience. “Movie Nights With the Reagans” is fluffed with a loyalist’s nostalgia, but it does offer entertaining glimpses of the first couple, and it may lure even Reagan nonenthusiasts to indulge in some nostalgia of their own.“Movie Nights With the Reagans” probably would have worked better as a half-hour oral history, but here it is, not unwelcome, if only to remind us that the role of the president can be played by a charming gentleman instead of a scoundrel.Thomas Mallon’s most recent book is “Finale: A Novel of the Reagan Years.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
