(The organizer is played by Clark Duke, from “Hot Tub Time Machine,” while Ellar Coltrane of “Boyhood” plays a colleague who peppers Vic with trivia.)Emphasizing how pathetic and lonely Vic has become and how cluelessly the festival treats him — putting him up in seedy lodging, shoving a video camera in his face — the first part of the film is almost as mortifying to watch as it probably is for Vic to experience. We’re meant to regard the festivalgoers as harmless, overly avid fans, but the potshots are too broad and cheap.“The Last Movie Star” takes a turn from cringeworthy fish-out-of-water comedy into anodyne sentimentality when Vic and his incongruously dressed driver, Lil (Ariel Winter) — a goth aspiring artist whose sketches were contributed by the “Hellraiser” director Clive Barker — escape to Vic’s hometown Knoxville, where he makes peace with his past.The director Adam Rifkin wrote this showcase for Mr. Reynolds, who, like Vic, was a college football player. “The Last Movie Star” effectively allows the ever-assured actor to score a touchdown on an empty field. To make it look as if Vic is conversing with his younger self, Mr. Rifkin edits in footage of Mr. Reynolds from “Smokey and the Bandit” and “Deliverance.” It’s a decent idea, but the matching is poor and the clips appear arbitrary.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
