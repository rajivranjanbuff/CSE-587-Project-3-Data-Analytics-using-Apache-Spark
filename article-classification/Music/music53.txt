AdvertisementThe Library of Congress on Wednesday announced its 25 annual additions to the National Recording Registry, honoring significant pieces of American history and culture. While some of the titles are instantly recognizable — the “Sound of Music” soundtrack, the Temptations’ “My Girl” and Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours” album — others are more significant for their influence on future generations.“Sitting on Top of the World” was recorded in 1930 by the Mississippi Sheiks. The malleable song would be performed in various styles, from folk to country to bluegrass: Cream, Howlin’ Wolf, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and Jack White all have versions.The National Recording Registry now has 500 titles. Others added this year include Bill Haley & His Comets’ “Rock Around the Clock,” Tony Bennett’s “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” Gloria Estefan’s “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,” Run-DMC’s “Raising Hell” album and Canario y Su Grupo’s “Lamento Borincano,” about the plight of a Puerto Rican farmer.Go to Home Page »
