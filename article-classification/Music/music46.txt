The trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis’s group delivered a dazzling account of the nearly hourlong piece on Saturday. The themes of the first movement, “Black,” were profoundly shaped and brought into rich dialogue; the “West Indian Dance” section of the second movement offered galvanizing swing. And the vocalist Brianna Thomas provided a powerful rendition of the “Blues” section (also part of “Brown”).Afterward, I revisited a collaboration between this orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, only recently released: a performance of an orchestral version of Ellington’s “A Tone Parallel to Harlem,” recorded at a Philharmonic concert in 1999. As conducted by Kurt Masur, this version of an Ellington touchstone differs in subtly rewarding ways from a 1970 recording made by the Duke himself with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (and on which string arrangements were likely provided by Luther Henderson).Read our review of the recital.Read our profile of Ms. Yende.Read about “Tristan” in Cleveland.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS
