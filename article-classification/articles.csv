"AdvertisementSupported byThe Library of Congress on Wednesday announced its 25 annual additions to the National Recording Registry, honoring significant pieces of American history and culture. While some of the titles are instantly recognizable — the “Sound of Music” soundtrack, the Temptations’ “My Girl” and Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours” album — others are more significant for their influence on future generations.“Sitting on Top of the World” was recorded in 1930 by the Mississippi Sheiks. The malleable song would be performed in various styles, from folk to country to bluegrass: Cream, Howlin’ Wolf, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and Jack White all have versions.The National Recording Registry now has 500 titles. Others added this year include Bill Haley & His Comets’ “Rock Around the Clock,” Tony Bennett’s “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” Gloria Estefan’s “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,” Run-DMC’s “Raising Hell” album and Canario y Su Grupo’s “Lamento Borincano,” about the plight of a Puerto Rican farmer.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music
"AdvertisementSupported byCapping the celebration of its 100th anniversary, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music on Wednesday announced a gift of $46.4 million from the William K. Bowes, Jr. Foundation, among the largest donations ever to an American music school.The gift will help fund construction of a $185 million, 12-story building on a site just south of San Francisco City Hall. Designed by Mark Cavagnero Associates and scheduled to open in 2020, it will include two concert halls, rehearsal spaces, high-tech studios and classrooms, and will provide housing for the student body.“It will shape the future of the conservatory, in one of the most exciting pieces of real estate in the world,” David H. Stull, the school’s president, said in a phone interview.Founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead, the San Francisco Conservatory is the oldest independent music school on the West Coast, with luminaries like Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern among the alumni of its youth program. While the school has long emphasized risk-taking and an expansive view of the field, Mr. Stull has pushed it and its curriculum toward the future since becoming president in 2013. Its program in Technology and Applied Composition (TAC), which began offering courses in 2015, has been forging a new identity for the 21st-century composer.Though both composition and technology are fields dominated by men, the TAC program has managed the rare achievement of gender parity, with 13 women and 12 men in its most recently completed cohort. (The conservatory’s traditional composition program had five women and 24 men in the same cohort.)Driving the program’s development has been its executive director, MaryClare Brzytwa, a composer and educator who combines classical training as a flutist with a background in computer music. She led efforts to recruit as visiting faculty women at the top of their fields in tech-related musical careers. Teachers such as the Grammy-winning Leslie Ann Jones (who directs music recording and scoring at Skywalker Sound) and Jaclyn Shumate (an audio director at Microsoft), Ms. Brzytwa said, “allow my students to see it as normal for women to have these careers.”TAC complements training in composition with special courses in software and studio technology to equip students for careers in such fields as film scoring and video game sound design, as well as in production. The new building, to be named the Ute and William K. Bowes, Jr. Center for Performing Arts, will house a special “technology hall” with a state-of-the-art recording studio and other equipment focused on TAC.“Our students learn how to write classical music and real-world production skills at the same time,” Ms. Brzytwa said. “Stylistically, they come from many perspectives — jazz, classical or electronic music — and there is a lot of leeway to plan a path of their own. But all of them seem to want rigor.”Even students who are not pursuing composition in the TAC program recognize its influence on the school’s direction. DuMarkus Davis, who is in his second year as a violin student, says he decided to move from his native Atlanta to San Francisco “because I wanted to do something involving musical entrepreneurship and wanted to be surrounded by the tech in Silicon Valley. I knew that the TAC program was an element of SFCM. All of that ultimately sold me on the conservatory.”Before coming to the school for TAC’s one-year professional studies program, Emily Pitts had earned a degree in software engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then spent five years in the corporate world, pursuing a passion for writing music for film and video games on the side. Even before graduating, she has been hired at Facebook to work with its 360 Spatial Workstation team to design spatial audio for its video player.“It’s a marriage between my engineering and audio interests,” Ms. Pitts said.“In the real world, it can feel intimidating, like you’re trying to get into this boys’ club,” she added. “Working with so many other women and seeing your peers succeed and excel has been great.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music
"AdvertisementSupported bythat decisive momentAt 7 minutes 23 secondsToday, there’s likely no better way to experience a live performance of Duke Ellington’s extended work “Black, Brown and Beige” than in a concert by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. The trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis’s group delivered a dazzling account of the nearly hourlong piece on Saturday. The themes of the first movement, “Black,” were profoundly shaped and brought into rich dialogue; the “West Indian Dance” section of the second movement offered galvanizing swing. And the vocalist Brianna Thomas provided a powerful rendition of the “Blues” section (also part of “Brown”).Afterward, I revisited a collaboration between this orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, only recently released: a performance of an orchestral version of Ellington’s “A Tone Parallel to Harlem,” recorded at a Philharmonic concert in 1999. As conducted by Kurt Masur, this version of an Ellington touchstone differs in subtly rewarding ways from a 1970 recording made by the Duke himself with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (and on which string arrangements were likely provided by Luther Henderson).Read our review of the recital.Read our profile of Ms. Yende.Read about “Tristan” in Cleveland.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music
"AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Hoffman is a classical violist and radio commentator.I was talking about music recently with a friend who makes his living cloning genes, manipulating molecules and investigating the pathways of the human immune system. This is a person whose intellectual molecules are clearly very well arranged. But he proceeded to tell me that although he loved classical music, when he listened to it he wasn’t able to perceive anything other than his own emotional reactions.Could it be true? Well, he thought it was. But he was wrong.What my friend was expressing was merely a symptom of a common affliction, one that crosses all intellectual, social and economic classes: the Classical Music Insecurity Complex. Immediate therapy was indicated.There’s no question, I pointed out, that he perceives more than just his own reactions. Lots more. In every piece he listens to he perceives changes, both great and small, in tempo, volume, pitch and instrumentation. He perceives melodies, harmonies and rhythms, and their patterns. He perceives, in short, virtually all the musical ingredients that composers manipulate to stimulate emotional effects, which is precisely why he’s emotionally affected. His “problem” isn’t perception — it’s description. And what he doesn’t know is the jargon, the technical terms for the ingredients and manipulations.And why should he? He’s a scientist, not a musician. And frankly, it’s not even essential that he be aware of the specific musical and technical means by which his reactions are being stimulated.Years ago I was rehearsing a piece for flute, viola and piano by the composer Seymour Barab. Mr. Barab was attending the rehearsal, and the pianist asked him at one point if it was important to “bring out,” or highlight, a certain clever rhythmic pattern. Mr. Barab’s instant reaction was to shout: “No! It’s none of your business!”It’s sad but true that many people denigrate and distrust their own reactions to classical music out of fear that they don’t “know enough,” and that other, more sophisticated folks know more. When people leave the movie theater they rarely hesitate to give their opinion of the movie, and it never occurs to them that they don’t have a right to that opinion. And yet after most classical music concerts you can swing your program around from any spot in the lobby and hit a dozen perfectly capable and intelligent people issuing apologetic disclaimers: “Boy, I really loved that — but I’m no expert” or “It sounded pretty awful to me, but I don’t really know anything, so I guess I just didn’t get it.”At least those people showed up. Many others are too intimidated to attend classical concerts at all.I’m all for knowledge — I’ve spent most of my career as a musician and commentator trying to help people learn more about music, and to remove any obstacles to the enjoyment of it. The Classical Music Insecurity Complex is a barrier of discomfort. Experience, exposure and familiarity play critical roles in helping to lower that barrier, and a little learning, along with basic explanations of technical (and foreign) terms and concepts, can be of great value.What is not of value, and is in fact completely off-putting and counterproductive, is the kind of introductory concert talk, review or program note that uses technical terms rather than plain English to explain other technical terms and to “describe” musical works. Program notes that use phrases like “the work features a truncated development with chromatic modulations to distant keys and modally inflected motivic cells,” for example, do not exactly help to break down barriers and put people at ease.Perhaps it’s overly optimistic of me, but I still cling to the hope that, with the right approaches and experiences, longtime sufferers will feel sufficiently encouraged to go ahead and jettison the C.M.I. Complex outright. I’d like the legions of actual and potential classical music lovers to believe that, like my friend the scientist, they hear more than they can name, and that the very point of listening to great music is to be moved, not to put names on what moves you.Miles Hoffman is the violist of the American Chamber Players and the classical music commentator for NPR’s “Morning Edition.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction.She does macro, too — she was joined onstage by approximately 100 dancers, singers and musicians, a stunning tableau that included fraternity pledges and drumlines and rows of female violinists in addition to the usual crackerjack backup dancers (which here included bone breakers and also dancers performing elaborate routines with cymbals).Some superstars prize effortlessness, but Beyoncé shows her work — the cameras captured the force and determination in her dancing, and also her sweat. She performed for almost two hours, with only a few breaks, and her voice rarely flagged. Occasionally her set was punctuated with fireworks that, compared with what was happening onstage, seemed dull.She was arguing not in defense of herself, but of her forebears. And her performance was as much ancestral tribute and cultural continuum — an uplifting of black womanhood — as contemporary concert. She sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” often referred to as the black national anthem, incorporated vocal snippets of Malcolm X and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and nodded at Ms. Simone’s “Lilac Wine.”And she rendered her personal history as well. During the second half of the show, she unfurled a kind of This Is Your Life in reverse. First came her husband, Jay-Z, on “Déjà Vu” — with him, she was affectionate while easily outshining him. Then, a true surprise: a reunion with her former Destiny’s Child groupmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, during which she happily ceded the main spotlight. After that came a playful dance routine with her sister, Solange, on “Get Me Bodied.” (Sadly, there was no “Ring Off” with her mother, nor a rendition of “Daddy Lessons” with her father.)Beyoncé performs at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 21; coachella.com.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

"AdvertisementSupported byThe premiere of the entire “Cellular Songs” on Wednesday evening had the cumulative force of some of her best writing. Joined with Ms. Monk’s installation-art scenarios (realized by the video artist Katherine Freer) and choreography, this linked series of pieces was a coherent meditation on themes of individual flourishing and collective belonging. The microscopic unit of measurement suggested by the title hardly represents the work’s ambitions.Concepts that engage individuality tend to be a bandleader’s dream, since they allow performers to show off singular talents — as here, with Allison Sniffin’s gifts on multiple instruments, or the lithely expressive dancing and finely controlled vibrato of Jo Stewart, the latest addition to the ensemble. Like Duke Ellington, Ms. Monk knows well how to weave solo lines tailored to specific performers (herself included), but her dramatic gifts are often clearest during passages involving multiple players.In “Hey-nyo,” a lengthy ensemble number that was the evening’s centerpiece, Ms. Monk charted numerous routes between clashing semitones, unsettling microtonal swoops and gentler harmonies. No sonic experience was given short shrift; by the end, a sense of calm felt honestly won.The formidable complexity of material like that helped the poetry of seemingly simpler numbers — like “Happy Woman,” in which Ms. Monk gradually offers up contradictory self-identifications (“I am an honest woman,” “I’m a lying woman”) — sneak up on a listener. That song’s unsheathing of new personalities — each different, yet connected to the ones before — seemed in tune with Yoshio Yabara’s subtly varied layers of costuming.Over 75 minutes, Ms. Monk spun together these divergent elements so fluidly that it created an unmistakable sense of hope. It’s much easier to conceive of bridging public divides — or even containing multitudes, as an individual — when you witness a synthesis like the one created in “Cellular Songs.” In a program note, Ms. Monk said she hoped to propose “an alternative possibility of human behavior, where the values are cooperation, interdependence and kindness, as an antidote to the values that are being propagated right now.”That’s a lofty goal, particularly for a music drama that works through abstract, mostly wordless means. But Ms. Monk’s approach to political content, so free of didacticism, is seductively clear and persuasive here. Occasionally it’s even humorous, as when video images of groups of hands dissolve between comically different arrangements (one moment solemnly posed, the next making duck-like forms and wiggling). At other times, the staging feels almost mythically profound, nowhere more so than when the core group is joined by members of the Young People’s Chorus of New York City.Ms. Monk has been making this sort of magic happen for a long time. But no matter how many decades she keeps creating them, works as strong as “Cellular Songs” will never feel rote.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

Like Duke Ellington, Ms. Monk knows well how to weave solo lines tailored to specific performers (herself included), but her dramatic gifts are often clearest during passages involving multiple players.In “Hey-nyo,” a lengthy ensemble number that was the evening’s centerpiece, Ms. Monk charted numerous routes between clashing semitones, unsettling microtonal swoops and gentler harmonies. No sonic experience was given short shrift; by the end, a sense of calm felt honestly won.The formidable complexity of material like that helped the poetry of seemingly simpler numbers — like “Happy Woman,” in which Ms. Monk gradually offers up contradictory self-identifications (“I am an honest woman,” “I’m a lying woman”) — sneak up on a listener. That song’s unsheathing of new personalities — each different, yet connected to the ones before — seemed in tune with Yoshio Yabara’s subtly varied layers of costuming.Over 75 minutes, Ms. Monk spun together these divergent elements so fluidly that it created an unmistakable sense of hope. It’s much easier to conceive of bridging public divides — or even containing multitudes, as an individual — when you witness a synthesis like the one created in “Cellular Songs.” In a program note, Ms. Monk said she hoped to propose “an alternative possibility of human behavior, where the values are cooperation, interdependence and kindness, as an antidote to the values that are being propagated right now.”That’s a lofty goal, particularly for a music drama that works through abstract, mostly wordless means. But Ms. Monk’s approach to political content, so free of didacticism, is seductively clear and persuasive here. Occasionally it’s even humorous, as when video images of groups of hands dissolve between comically different arrangements (one moment solemnly posed, the next making duck-like forms and wiggling). At other times, the staging feels almost mythically profound, nowhere more so than when the core group is joined by members of the Young People’s Chorus of New York City.Ms. Monk has been making this sort of magic happen for a long time.

"AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Hoffman is a classical violist and radio commentator.I was talking about music recently with a friend who makes his living cloning genes, manipulating molecules and investigating the pathways of the human immune system. This is a person whose intellectual molecules are clearly very well arranged. But he proceeded to tell me that although he loved classical music, when he listened to it he wasn’t able to perceive anything other than his own emotional reactions.Could it be true? Well, he thought it was. But he was wrong.What my friend was expressing was merely a symptom of a common affliction, one that crosses all intellectual, social and economic classes: the Classical Music Insecurity Complex. Immediate therapy was indicated.There’s no question, I pointed out, that he perceives more than just his own reactions. Lots more. In every piece he listens to he perceives changes, both great and small, in tempo, volume, pitch and instrumentation. He perceives melodies, harmonies and rhythms, and their patterns. He perceives, in short, virtually all the musical ingredients that composers manipulate to stimulate emotional effects, which is precisely why he’s emotionally affected. His “problem” isn’t perception — it’s description. And what he doesn’t know is the jargon, the technical terms for the ingredients and manipulations.And why should he? He’s a scientist, not a musician. And frankly, it’s not even essential that he be aware of the specific musical and technical means by which his reactions are being stimulated.Years ago I was rehearsing a piece for flute, viola and piano by the composer Seymour Barab. Mr. Barab was attending the rehearsal, and the pianist asked him at one point if it was important to “bring out,” or highlight, a certain clever rhythmic pattern. Mr. Barab’s instant reaction was to shout: “No! It’s none of your business!”It’s sad but true that many people denigrate and distrust their own reactions to classical music out of fear that they don’t “know enough,” and that other, more sophisticated folks know more. When people leave the movie theater they rarely hesitate to give their opinion of the movie, and it never occurs to them that they don’t have a right to that opinion. And yet after most classical music concerts you can swing your program around from any spot in the lobby and hit a dozen perfectly capable and intelligent people issuing apologetic disclaimers: “Boy, I really loved that — but I’m no expert” or “It sounded pretty awful to me, but I don’t really know anything, so I guess I just didn’t get it.”At least those people showed up. Many others are too intimidated to attend classical concerts at all.I’m all for knowledge — I’ve spent most of my career as a musician and commentator trying to help people learn more about music, and to remove any obstacles to the enjoyment of it. The Classical Music Insecurity Complex is a barrier of discomfort. Experience, exposure and familiarity play critical roles in helping to lower that barrier, and a little learning, along with basic explanations of technical (and foreign) terms and concepts, can be of great value.What is not of value, and is in fact completely off-putting and counterproductive, is the kind of introductory concert talk, review or program note that uses technical terms rather than plain English to explain other technical terms and to “describe” musical works. Program notes that use phrases like “the work features a truncated development with chromatic modulations to distant keys and modally inflected motivic cells,” for example, do not exactly help to break down barriers and put people at ease.Perhaps it’s overly optimistic of me, but I still cling to the hope that, with the right approaches and experiences, longtime sufferers will feel sufficiently encouraged to go ahead and jettison the C.M.I. Complex outright. I’d like the legions of actual and potential classical music lovers to believe that, like my friend the scientist, they hear more than they can name, and that the very point of listening to great music is to be moved, not to put names on what moves you.Miles Hoffman is the violist of the American Chamber Players and the classical music commentator for NPR’s “Morning Edition.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

A gobsmacking marvel of choreography and musical direction.She does macro, too — she was joined onstage by approximately 100 dancers, singers and musicians, a stunning tableau that included fraternity pledges and drumlines and rows of female violinists in addition to the usual crackerjack backup dancers (which here included bone breakers and also dancers performing elaborate routines with cymbals).Some superstars prize effortlessness, but Beyoncé shows her work — the cameras captured the force and determination in her dancing, and also her sweat. She performed for almost two hours, with only a few breaks, and her voice rarely flagged. Occasionally her set was punctuated with fireworks that, compared with what was happening onstage, seemed dull.She was arguing not in defense of herself, but of her forebears. And her performance was as much ancestral tribute and cultural continuum — an uplifting of black womanhood — as contemporary concert. She sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” often referred to as the black national anthem, incorporated vocal snippets of Malcolm X and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and nodded at Ms. Simone’s “Lilac Wine.”And she rendered her personal history as well. During the second half of the show, she unfurled a kind of This Is Your Life in reverse. First came her husband, Jay-Z, on “Déjà Vu” — with him, she was affectionate while easily outshining him. Then, a true surprise: a reunion with her former Destiny’s Child groupmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, during which she happily ceded the main spotlight. After that came a playful dance routine with her sister, Solange, on “Get Me Bodied.” (Sadly, there was no “Ring Off” with her mother, nor a rendition of “Daddy Lessons” with her father.)Beyoncé performs at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 21; coachella.com.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music
"AdvertisementCapping the celebration of its 100th anniversary, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music on Wednesday announced a gift of $46.4 million from the William K. Bowes, Jr. Foundation, among the largest donations ever to an American music school.The gift will help fund construction of a $185 million, 12-story building on a site just south of San Francisco City Hall. Designed by Mark Cavagnero Associates and scheduled to open in 2020, it will include two concert halls, rehearsal spaces, high-tech studios and classrooms, and will provide housing for the student body.“It will shape the future of the conservatory, in one of the most exciting pieces of real estate in the world,” David H. Stull, the school’s president, said in a phone interview.Founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead, the San Francisco Conservatory is the oldest independent music school on the West Coast, with luminaries like Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern among the alumni of its youth program. While the school has long emphasized risk-taking and an expansive view of the field, Mr. Stull has pushed it and its curriculum toward the future since becoming president in 2013. Its program in Technology and Applied Composition (TAC), which began offering courses in 2015, has been forging a new identity for the 21st-century composer.AdvertisementThough both composition and technology are fields dominated by men, the TAC program has managed the rare achievement of gender parity, with 13 women and 12 men in its most recently completed cohort. (The conservatory’s traditional composition program had five women and 24 men in the same cohort.)Driving the program’s development has been its executive director, MaryClare Brzytwa, a composer and educator who combines classical training as a flutist with a background in computer music. She led efforts to recruit as visiting faculty women at the top of their fields in tech-related musical careers. Teachers such as the Grammy-winning Leslie Ann Jones (who directs music recording and scoring at Skywalker Sound) and Jaclyn Shumate (an audio director at Microsoft), Ms. Brzytwa said, “allow my students to see it as normal for women to have these careers.”AdvertisementTAC complements training in composition with special courses in software and studio technology to equip students for careers in such fields as film scoring and video game sound design, as well as in production. The new building, to be named the Ute and William K. Bowes, Jr. Center for Performing Arts, will house a special “technology hall” with a state-of-the-art recording studio and other equipment focused on TAC.“Our students learn how to write classical music and real-world production skills at the same time,” Ms. Brzytwa said. “Stylistically, they come from many perspectives — jazz, classical or electronic music — and there is a lot of leeway to plan a path of their own. But all of them seem to want rigor.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

DuMarkus Davis, who is in his second year as a violin student, says he decided to move from his native Atlanta to San Francisco “because I wanted to do something involving musical entrepreneurship and wanted to be surrounded by the tech in Silicon Valley. I knew that the TAC program was an element of SFCM. All of that ultimately sold me on the conservatory.”Before coming to the school for TAC’s one-year professional studies program, Emily Pitts had earned a degree in software engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then spent five years in the corporate world, pursuing a passion for writing music for film and video games on the side. Even before graduating, she has been hired at Facebook to work with its 360 Spatial Workstation team to design spatial audio for its video player.“It’s a marriage between my engineering and audio interests,” Ms. Pitts said.“In the real world, it can feel intimidating, like you’re trying to get into this boys’ club,” she added. “Working with so many other women and seeing your peers succeed and excel has been great.”Go to Home Page »",Music

The themes of the first movement, “Black,” were profoundly shaped and brought into rich dialogue; the “West Indian Dance” section of the second movement offered galvanizing swing.

The microscopic unit of measurement suggested by the title hardly represents the work’s ambitions.Concepts that engage individuality tend to be a bandleader’s dream, since they allow performers to show off singular talents — as here, with Allison Sniffin’s gifts on multiple instruments, or the lithely expressive dancing and finely controlled vibrato of Jo Stewart, the latest addition to the ensemble. Like Duke Ellington, Ms. Monk knows well how to weave solo lines tailored to specific performers (herself included), but her dramatic gifts are often clearest during passages involving multiple players.In “Hey-nyo,” a lengthy ensemble number that was the evening’s centerpiece, Ms. Monk charted numerous routes between clashing semitones, unsettling microtonal swoops and gentler harmonies.

"AdvertisementSupported byThe premiere of the entire “Cellular Songs” on Wednesday evening had the cumulative force of some of her best writing. Joined with Ms. Monk’s installation-art scenarios (realized by the video artist Katherine Freer) and choreography, this linked series of pieces was a coherent meditation on themes of individual flourishing and collective belonging. The microscopic unit of measurement suggested by the title hardly represents the work’s ambitions.Concepts that engage individuality tend to be a bandleader’s dream, since they allow performers to show off singular talents — as here, with Allison Sniffin’s gifts on multiple instruments, or the lithely expressive dancing and finely controlled vibrato of Jo Stewart, the latest addition to the ensemble. Like Duke Ellington, Ms. Monk knows well how to weave solo lines tailored to specific performers (herself included), but her dramatic gifts are often clearest during passages involving multiple players.In “Hey-nyo,” a lengthy ensemble number that was the evening’s centerpiece, Ms. Monk charted numerous routes between clashing semitones, unsettling microtonal swoops and gentler harmonies. No sonic experience was given short shrift; by the end, a sense of calm felt honestly won.The formidable complexity of material like that helped the poetry of seemingly simpler numbers — like “Happy Woman,” in which Ms. Monk gradually offers up contradictory self-identifications (“I am an honest woman,” “I’m a lying woman”) — sneak up on a listener. That song’s unsheathing of new personalities — each different, yet connected to the ones before — seemed in tune with Yoshio Yabara’s subtly varied layers of costuming.Over 75 minutes, Ms. Monk spun together these divergent elements so fluidly that it created an unmistakable sense of hope. It’s much easier to conceive of bridging public divides — or even containing multitudes, as an individual — when you witness a synthesis like the one created in “Cellular Songs.” In a program note, Ms. Monk said she hoped to propose “an alternative possibility of human behavior, where the values are cooperation, interdependence and kindness, as an antidote to the values that are being propagated right now.”That’s a lofty goal, particularly for a music drama that works through abstract, mostly wordless means. But Ms. Monk’s approach to political content, so free of didacticism, is seductively clear and persuasive here. Occasionally it’s even humorous, as when video images of groups of hands dissolve between comically different arrangements (one moment solemnly posed, the next making duck-like forms and wiggling). At other times, the staging feels almost mythically profound, nowhere more so than when the core group is joined by members of the Young People’s Chorus of New York City.Ms. Monk has been making this sort of magic happen for a long time. But no matter how many decades she keeps creating them, works as strong as “Cellular Songs” will never feel rote.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music
"AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Hoffman is a classical violist and radio commentator.I was talking about music recently with a friend who makes his living cloning genes, manipulating molecules and investigating the pathways of the human immune system. This is a person whose intellectual molecules are clearly very well arranged. But he proceeded to tell me that although he loved classical music, when he listened to it he wasn’t able to perceive anything other than his own emotional reactions.Could it be true? Well, he thought it was. But he was wrong.What my friend was expressing was merely a symptom of a common affliction, one that crosses all intellectual, social and economic classes: the Classical Music Insecurity Complex. Immediate therapy was indicated.There’s no question, I pointed out, that he perceives more than just his own reactions. Lots more. In every piece he listens to he perceives changes, both great and small, in tempo, volume, pitch and instrumentation. He perceives melodies, harmonies and rhythms, and their patterns. He perceives, in short, virtually all the musical ingredients that composers manipulate to stimulate emotional effects, which is precisely why he’s emotionally affected. His “problem” isn’t perception — it’s description. And what he doesn’t know is the jargon, the technical terms for the ingredients and manipulations.And why should he? He’s a scientist, not a musician. And frankly, it’s not even essential that he be aware of the specific musical and technical means by which his reactions are being stimulated.Years ago I was rehearsing a piece for flute, viola and piano by the composer Seymour Barab. Mr. Barab was attending the rehearsal, and the pianist asked him at one point if it was important to “bring out,” or highlight, a certain clever rhythmic pattern. Mr. Barab’s instant reaction was to shout: “No! It’s none of your business!”It’s sad but true that many people denigrate and distrust their own reactions to classical music out of fear that they don’t “know enough,” and that other, more sophisticated folks know more. When people leave the movie theater they rarely hesitate to give their opinion of the movie, and it never occurs to them that they don’t have a right to that opinion. And yet after most classical music concerts you can swing your program around from any spot in the lobby and hit a dozen perfectly capable and intelligent people issuing apologetic disclaimers: “Boy, I really loved that — but I’m no expert” or “It sounded pretty awful to me, but I don’t really know anything, so I guess I just didn’t get it.”At least those people showed up. Many others are too intimidated to attend classical concerts at all.I’m all for knowledge — I’ve spent most of my career as a musician and commentator trying to help people learn more about music, and to remove any obstacles to the enjoyment of it. The Classical Music Insecurity Complex is a barrier of discomfort. Experience, exposure and familiarity play critical roles in helping to lower that barrier, and a little learning, along with basic explanations of technical (and foreign) terms and concepts, can be of great value.What is not of value, and is in fact completely off-putting and counterproductive, is the kind of introductory concert talk, review or program note that uses technical terms rather than plain English to explain other technical terms and to “describe” musical works. Program notes that use phrases like “the work features a truncated development with chromatic modulations to distant keys and modally inflected motivic cells,” for example, do not exactly help to break down barriers and put people at ease.Perhaps it’s overly optimistic of me, but I still cling to the hope that, with the right approaches and experiences, longtime sufferers will feel sufficiently encouraged to go ahead and jettison the C.M.I. Complex outright. I’d like the legions of actual and potential classical music lovers to believe that, like my friend the scientist, they hear more than they can name, and that the very point of listening to great music is to be moved, not to put names on what moves you.Miles Hoffman is the violist of the American Chamber Players and the classical music commentator for NPR’s “Morning Edition.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

"AdvertisementSupported byCapping the celebration of its 100th anniversary, the San Francisco Conservatory of Music on Wednesday announced a gift of $46.4 million from the William K. Bowes, Jr. Foundation, among the largest donations ever to an American music school.The gift will help fund construction of a $185 million, 12-story building on a site just south of San Francisco City Hall. Designed by Mark Cavagnero Associates and scheduled to open in 2020, it will include two concert halls, rehearsal spaces, high-tech studios and classrooms, and will provide housing for the student body.“It will shape the future of the conservatory, in one of the most exciting pieces of real estate in the world,” David H. Stull, the school’s president, said in a phone interview.Founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead, the San Francisco Conservatory is the oldest independent music school on the West Coast, with luminaries like Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern among the alumni of its youth program. While the school has long emphasized risk-taking and an expansive view of the field, Mr. Stull has pushed it and its curriculum toward the future since becoming president in 2013. Its program in Technology and Applied Composition (TAC), which began offering courses in 2015, has been forging a new identity for the 21st-century composer.Though both composition and technology are fields dominated by men, the TAC program has managed the rare achievement of gender parity, with 13 women and 12 men in its most recently completed cohort. (The conservatory’s traditional composition program had five women and 24 men in the same cohort.)Driving the program’s development has been its executive director, MaryClare Brzytwa, a composer and educator who combines classical training as a flutist with a background in computer music. She led efforts to recruit as visiting faculty women at the top of their fields in tech-related musical careers. Teachers such as the Grammy-winning Leslie Ann Jones (who directs music recording and scoring at Skywalker Sound) and Jaclyn Shumate (an audio director at Microsoft), Ms. Brzytwa said, “allow my students to see it as normal for women to have these careers.”TAC complements training in composition with special courses in software and studio technology to equip students for careers in such fields as film scoring and video game sound design, as well as in production. The new building, to be named the Ute and William K. Bowes, Jr. Center for Performing Arts, will house a special “technology hall” with a state-of-the-art recording studio and other equipment focused on TAC.“Our students learn how to write classical music and real-world production skills at the same time,” Ms. Brzytwa said. “Stylistically, they come from many perspectives — jazz, classical or electronic music — and there is a lot of leeway to plan a path of their own. But all of them seem to want rigor.”Even students who are not pursuing composition in the TAC program recognize its influence on the school’s direction. DuMarkus Davis, who is in his second year as a violin student, says he decided to move from his native Atlanta to San Francisco “because I wanted to do something involving musical entrepreneurship and wanted to be surrounded by the tech in Silicon Valley. I knew that the TAC program was an element of SFCM. All of that ultimately sold me on the conservatory.”Before coming to the school for TAC’s one-year professional studies program, Emily Pitts had earned a degree in software engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then spent five years in the corporate world, pursuing a passion for writing music for film and video games on the side. Even before graduating, she has been hired at Facebook to work with its 360 Spatial Workstation team to design spatial audio for its video player.“It’s a marriage between my engineering and audio interests,” Ms. Pitts said.“In the real world, it can feel intimidating, like you’re trying to get into this boys’ club,” she added. “Working with so many other women and seeing your peers succeed and excel has been great.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

The trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis’s group delivered a dazzling account of the nearly hourlong piece on Saturday. The themes of the first movement, “Black,” were profoundly shaped and brought into rich dialogue; the “West Indian Dance” section of the second movement offered galvanizing swing. And the vocalist Brianna Thomas provided a powerful rendition of the “Blues” section (also part of “Brown”).Afterward, I revisited a collaboration between this orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, only recently released: a performance of an orchestral version of Ellington’s “A Tone Parallel to Harlem,” recorded at a Philharmonic concert in 1999. As conducted by Kurt Masur, this version of an Ellington touchstone differs in subtly rewarding ways from a 1970 recording made by the Duke himself with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (and on which string arrangements were likely provided by Luther Henderson).Read our review of the recital.Read our profile of Ms. Yende.Read about “Tristan” in Cleveland.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

She led efforts to recruit as visiting faculty women at the top of their fields in tech-related musical careers. Teachers such as the Grammy-winning Leslie Ann Jones (who directs music recording and scoring at Skywalker Sound) and Jaclyn Shumate (an audio director at Microsoft), Ms. Brzytwa said, “allow my students to see it as normal for women to have these careers.”TAC complements training in composition with special courses in software and studio technology to equip students for careers in such fields as film scoring and video game sound design, as well as in production. The new building, to be named the Ute and William K. Bowes, Jr. Center for Performing Arts, will house a special “technology hall” with a state-of-the-art recording studio and other equipment focused on TAC.“Our students learn how to write classical music and real-world production skills at the same time,” Ms. Brzytwa said. “Stylistically, they come from many perspectives — jazz, classical or electronic music — and there is a lot of leeway to plan a path of their own. But all of them seem to want rigor.”Even students who are not pursuing composition in the TAC program recognize its influence on the school’s direction. DuMarkus Davis, who is in his second year as a violin student, says he decided to move from his native Atlanta to San Francisco “because I wanted to do something involving musical entrepreneurship and wanted to be surrounded by the tech in Silicon Valley. I knew that the TAC program was an element of SFCM. All of that ultimately sold me on the conservatory.”Before coming to the school for TAC’s one-year professional studies program, Emily Pitts had earned a degree in software engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then spent five years in the corporate world, pursuing a passion for writing music for film and video games on the side. Even before graduating, she has been hired at Facebook to work with its 360 Spatial Workstation team to design spatial audio for its video player.“It’s a marriage between my engineering and audio interests,” Ms. Pitts said.“In the real world, it can feel intimidating, like you’re trying to get into this boys’ club,” she added. “Working with so many other women and seeing your peers succeed and excel has been great.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music
"AdvertisementSupported bythat decisive momentAt 7 minutes 23 secondsToday, there’s likely no better way to experience a live performance of Duke Ellington’s extended work “Black, Brown and Beige” than in a concert by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. The trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis’s group delivered a dazzling account of the nearly hourlong piece on Saturday. The themes of the first movement, “Black,” were profoundly shaped and brought into rich dialogue; the “West Indian Dance” section of the second movement offered galvanizing swing. And the vocalist Brianna Thomas provided a powerful rendition of the “Blues” section (also part of “Brown”).Afterward, I revisited a collaboration between this orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, only recently released: a performance of an orchestral version of Ellington’s “A Tone Parallel to Harlem,” recorded at a Philharmonic concert in 1999. As conducted by Kurt Masur, this version of an Ellington touchstone differs in subtly rewarding ways from a 1970 recording made by the Duke himself with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (and on which string arrangements were likely provided by Luther Henderson).Read our review of the recital.Read our profile of Ms. Yende.Read about “Tristan” in Cleveland.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music
"AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Hoffman is a classical violist and radio commentator.I was talking about music recently with a friend who makes his living cloning genes, manipulating molecules and investigating the pathways of the human immune system. This is a person whose intellectual molecules are clearly very well arranged. But he proceeded to tell me that although he loved classical music, when he listened to it he wasn’t able to perceive anything other than his own emotional reactions.Could it be true? Well, he thought it was. But he was wrong.What my friend was expressing was merely a symptom of a common affliction, one that crosses all intellectual, social and economic classes: the Classical Music Insecurity Complex. Immediate therapy was indicated.There’s no question, I pointed out, that he perceives more than just his own reactions. Lots more. In every piece he listens to he perceives changes, both great and small, in tempo, volume, pitch and instrumentation. He perceives melodies, harmonies and rhythms, and their patterns. He perceives, in short, virtually all the musical ingredients that composers manipulate to stimulate emotional effects, which is precisely why he’s emotionally affected. His “problem” isn’t perception — it’s description. And what he doesn’t know is the jargon, the technical terms for the ingredients and manipulations.And why should he? He’s a scientist, not a musician. And frankly, it’s not even essential that he be aware of the specific musical and technical means by which his reactions are being stimulated.Years ago I was rehearsing a piece for flute, viola and piano by the composer Seymour Barab. Mr. Barab was attending the rehearsal, and the pianist asked him at one point if it was important to “bring out,” or highlight, a certain clever rhythmic pattern. Mr. Barab’s instant reaction was to shout: “No! It’s none of your business!”It’s sad but true that many people denigrate and distrust their own reactions to classical music out of fear that they don’t “know enough,” and that other, more sophisticated folks know more. When people leave the movie theater they rarely hesitate to give their opinion of the movie, and it never occurs to them that they don’t have a right to that opinion. And yet after most classical music concerts you can swing your program around from any spot in the lobby and hit a dozen perfectly capable and intelligent people issuing apologetic disclaimers: “Boy, I really loved that — but I’m no expert” or “It sounded pretty awful to me, but I don’t really know anything, so I guess I just didn’t get it.”At least those people showed up. Many others are too intimidated to attend classical concerts at all.I’m all for knowledge — I’ve spent most of my career as a musician and commentator trying to help people learn more about music, and to remove any obstacles to the enjoyment of it. The Classical Music Insecurity Complex is a barrier of discomfort. Experience, exposure and familiarity play critical roles in helping to lower that barrier, and a little learning, along with basic explanations of technical (and foreign) terms and concepts, can be of great value.What is not of value, and is in fact completely off-putting and counterproductive, is the kind of introductory concert talk, review or program note that uses technical terms rather than plain English to explain other technical terms and to “describe” musical works. Program notes that use phrases like “the work features a truncated development with chromatic modulations to distant keys and modally inflected motivic cells,” for example, do not exactly help to break down barriers and put people at ease.Perhaps it’s overly optimistic of me, but I still cling to the hope that, with the right approaches and experiences, longtime sufferers will feel sufficiently encouraged to go ahead and jettison the C.M.I. Complex outright. I’d like the legions of actual and potential classical music lovers to believe that, like my friend the scientist, they hear more than they can name, and that the very point of listening to great music is to be moved, not to put names on what moves you.Miles Hoffman is the violist of the American Chamber Players and the classical music commentator for NPR’s “Morning Edition.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

And her performance was as much ancestral tribute and cultural continuum — an uplifting of black womanhood — as contemporary concert. She sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” often referred to as the black national anthem, incorporated vocal snippets of Malcolm X and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and nodded at Ms. Simone’s “Lilac Wine.”And she rendered her personal history as well. During the second half of the show, she unfurled a kind of This Is Your Life in reverse. First came her husband, Jay-Z, on “Déjà Vu” — with him, she was affectionate while easily outshining him. Then, a true surprise: a reunion with her former Destiny’s Child groupmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams, during which she happily ceded the main spotlight. After that came a playful dance routine with her sister, Solange, on “Get Me Bodied.” (Sadly, there was no “Ring Off” with her mother, nor a rendition of “Daddy Lessons” with her father.)Beyoncé performs at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 21; coachella.com.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

Bowes, Jr. Foundation, among the largest donations ever to an American music school.The gift will help fund construction of a $185 million, 12-story building on a site just south of San Francisco City Hall. Designed by Mark Cavagnero Associates and scheduled to open in 2020, it will include two concert halls, rehearsal spaces, high-tech studios and classrooms, and will provide housing for the student body.“It will shape the future of the conservatory, in one of the most exciting pieces of real estate in the world,” David H. Stull, the school’s president, said in a phone interview.Founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead, the San Francisco Conservatory is the oldest independent music school on the West Coast, with luminaries like Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern among the alumni of its youth program. While the school has long emphasized risk-taking and an expansive view of the field, Mr. Stull has pushed it and its curriculum toward the future since becoming president in 2013. Its program in Technology and Applied Composition (TAC), which began offering courses in 2015, has been forging a new identity for the 21st-century composer.Though both composition and technology are fields dominated by men, the TAC program has managed the rare achievement of gender parity, with 13 women and 12 men in its most recently completed cohort.

"AdvertisementSupported byOp-Ed ContributorMr. Hoffman is a classical violist and radio commentator.I was talking about music recently with a friend who makes his living cloning genes, manipulating molecules and investigating the pathways of the human immune system. This is a person whose intellectual molecules are clearly very well arranged. But he proceeded to tell me that although he loved classical music, when he listened to it he wasn’t able to perceive anything other than his own emotional reactions.Could it be true? Well, he thought it was. But he was wrong.What my friend was expressing was merely a symptom of a common affliction, one that crosses all intellectual, social and economic classes: the Classical Music Insecurity Complex. Immediate therapy was indicated.There’s no question, I pointed out, that he perceives more than just his own reactions. Lots more. In every piece he listens to he perceives changes, both great and small, in tempo, volume, pitch and instrumentation. He perceives melodies, harmonies and rhythms, and their patterns. He perceives, in short, virtually all the musical ingredients that composers manipulate to stimulate emotional effects, which is precisely why he’s emotionally affected. His “problem” isn’t perception — it’s description. And what he doesn’t know is the jargon, the technical terms for the ingredients and manipulations.And why should he? He’s a scientist, not a musician. And frankly, it’s not even essential that he be aware of the specific musical and technical means by which his reactions are being stimulated.Years ago I was rehearsing a piece for flute, viola and piano by the composer Seymour Barab. Mr. Barab was attending the rehearsal, and the pianist asked him at one point if it was important to “bring out,” or highlight, a certain clever rhythmic pattern. Mr. Barab’s instant reaction was to shout: “No! It’s none of your business!”It’s sad but true that many people denigrate and distrust their own reactions to classical music out of fear that they don’t “know enough,” and that other, more sophisticated folks know more. When people leave the movie theater they rarely hesitate to give their opinion of the movie, and it never occurs to them that they don’t have a right to that opinion. And yet after most classical music concerts you can swing your program around from any spot in the lobby and hit a dozen perfectly capable and intelligent people issuing apologetic disclaimers: “Boy, I really loved that — but I’m no expert” or “It sounded pretty awful to me, but I don’t really know anything, so I guess I just didn’t get it.”At least those people showed up. Many others are too intimidated to attend classical concerts at all.I’m all for knowledge — I’ve spent most of my career as a musician and commentator trying to help people learn more about music, and to remove any obstacles to the enjoyment of it. The Classical Music Insecurity Complex is a barrier of discomfort. Experience, exposure and familiarity play critical roles in helping to lower that barrier, and a little learning, along with basic explanations of technical (and foreign) terms and concepts, can be of great value.What is not of value, and is in fact completely off-putting and counterproductive, is the kind of introductory concert talk, review or program note that uses technical terms rather than plain English to explain other technical terms and to “describe” musical works. Program notes that use phrases like “the work features a truncated development with chromatic modulations to distant keys and modally inflected motivic cells,” for example, do not exactly help to break down barriers and put people at ease.Perhaps it’s overly optimistic of me, but I still cling to the hope that, with the right approaches and experiences, longtime sufferers will feel sufficiently encouraged to go ahead and jettison the C.M.I. Complex outright. I’d like the legions of actual and potential classical music lovers to believe that, like my friend the scientist, they hear more than they can name, and that the very point of listening to great music is to be moved, not to put names on what moves you.Miles Hoffman is the violist of the American Chamber Players and the classical music commentator for NPR’s “Morning Edition.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

"AdvertisementSupported byThe premiere of the entire “Cellular Songs” on Wednesday evening had the cumulative force of some of her best writing. Joined with Ms. Monk’s installation-art scenarios (realized by the video artist Katherine Freer) and choreography, this linked series of pieces was a coherent meditation on themes of individual flourishing and collective belonging. The microscopic unit of measurement suggested by the title hardly represents the work’s ambitions.Concepts that engage individuality tend to be a bandleader’s dream, since they allow performers to show off singular talents — as here, with Allison Sniffin’s gifts on multiple instruments, or the lithely expressive dancing and finely controlled vibrato of Jo Stewart, the latest addition to the ensemble. Like Duke Ellington, Ms. Monk knows well how to weave solo lines tailored to specific performers (herself included), but her dramatic gifts are often clearest during passages involving multiple players.In “Hey-nyo,” a lengthy ensemble number that was the evening’s centerpiece, Ms. Monk charted numerous routes between clashing semitones, unsettling microtonal swoops and gentler harmonies. No sonic experience was given short shrift; by the end, a sense of calm felt honestly won.The formidable complexity of material like that helped the poetry of seemingly simpler numbers — like “Happy Woman,” in which Ms. Monk gradually offers up contradictory self-identifications (“I am an honest woman,” “I’m a lying woman”) — sneak up on a listener. That song’s unsheathing of new personalities — each different, yet connected to the ones before — seemed in tune with Yoshio Yabara’s subtly varied layers of costuming.Over 75 minutes, Ms. Monk spun together these divergent elements so fluidly that it created an unmistakable sense of hope. It’s much easier to conceive of bridging public divides — or even containing multitudes, as an individual — when you witness a synthesis like the one created in “Cellular Songs.” In a program note, Ms. Monk said she hoped to propose “an alternative possibility of human behavior, where the values are cooperation, interdependence and kindness, as an antidote to the values that are being propagated right now.”That’s a lofty goal, particularly for a music drama that works through abstract, mostly wordless means. But Ms. Monk’s approach to political content, so free of didacticism, is seductively clear and persuasive here. Occasionally it’s even humorous, as when video images of groups of hands dissolve between comically different arrangements (one moment solemnly posed, the next making duck-like forms and wiggling). At other times, the staging feels almost mythically profound, nowhere more so than when the core group is joined by members of the Young People’s Chorus of New York City.Ms. Monk has been making this sort of magic happen for a long time. But no matter how many decades she keeps creating them, works as strong as “Cellular Songs” will never feel rote.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

"AdvertisementSupported byThe Library of Congress on Wednesday announced its 25 annual additions to the National Recording Registry, honoring significant pieces of American history and culture. While some of the titles are instantly recognizable — the “Sound of Music” soundtrack, the Temptations’ “My Girl” and Fleetwood Mac’s “Rumours” album — others are more significant for their influence on future generations.“Sitting on Top of the World” was recorded in 1930 by the Mississippi Sheiks. The malleable song would be performed in various styles, from folk to country to bluegrass: Cream, Howlin’ Wolf, Willie Nelson, Bob Dylan and Jack White all have versions.The National Recording Registry now has 500 titles. Others added this year include Bill Haley & His Comets’ “Rock Around the Clock,” Tony Bennett’s “I Left My Heart in San Francisco,” Gloria Estefan’s “Rhythm Is Gonna Get You,” Run-DMC’s “Raising Hell” album and Canario y Su Grupo’s “Lamento Borincano,” about the plight of a Puerto Rican farmer.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music
"AdvertisementSupported bythat decisive momentAt 7 minutes 23 secondsToday, there’s likely no better way to experience a live performance of Duke Ellington’s extended work “Black, Brown and Beige” than in a concert by the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra. The trumpeter and composer Wynton Marsalis’s group delivered a dazzling account of the nearly hourlong piece on Saturday. The themes of the first movement, “Black,” were profoundly shaped and brought into rich dialogue; the “West Indian Dance” section of the second movement offered galvanizing swing. And the vocalist Brianna Thomas provided a powerful rendition of the “Blues” section (also part of “Brown”).Afterward, I revisited a collaboration between this orchestra and the New York Philharmonic, only recently released: a performance of an orchestral version of Ellington’s “A Tone Parallel to Harlem,” recorded at a Philharmonic concert in 1999. As conducted by Kurt Masur, this version of an Ellington touchstone differs in subtly rewarding ways from a 1970 recording made by the Duke himself with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (and on which string arrangements were likely provided by Luther Henderson).Read our review of the recital.Read our profile of Ms. Yende.Read about “Tristan” in Cleveland.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Music

Stull, the school’s president, said in a phone interview.Founded in 1917 by Ada Clement and Lillian Hodghead, the San Francisco Conservatory is the oldest independent music school on the West Coast, with luminaries like Yehudi Menuhin and Isaac Stern among the alumni of its youth program. While the school has long emphasized risk-taking and an expansive view of the field, Mr. Stull has pushed it and its curriculum toward the future since becoming president in 2013. Its program in Technology and Applied Composition (TAC), which began offering courses in 2015, has been forging a new identity for the 21st-century composer.AdvertisementThough both composition and technology are fields dominated by men, the TAC program has managed the rare achievement of gender parity, with 13 women and 12 men in its most recently completed cohort. (The conservatory’s traditional composition program had five women and 24 men in the same cohort.)Driving the program’s development has been its executive director, MaryClare Brzytwa, a composer and educator who combines classical training as a flutist with a background in computer music. She led efforts to recruit as visiting faculty women at the top of their fields in tech-related musical careers. Teachers such as the Grammy-winning Leslie Ann Jones (who directs music recording and scoring at Skywalker Sound) and Jaclyn Shumate (an audio director at Microsoft), Ms. Brzytwa said, “allow my students to see it as normal for women to have these careers.”AdvertisementTAC complements training in composition with special courses in software and studio technology to equip students for careers in such fields as film scoring and video game sound design, as well as in production. The new building, to be named the Ute and William K. Bowes, Jr. Center for Performing Arts, will house a special “technology hall” with a state-of-the-art recording studio and other equipment focused on TAC.“Our students learn how to write classical music and real-world production skills at the same time,” Ms. Brzytwa said. “Stylistically, they come from many perspectives — jazz, classical or electronic music — and there is a lot of leeway to plan a path of their own. But all of them seem to want rigor.”Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address.

DuMarkus Davis, who is in his second year as a violin student, says he decided to move from his native Atlanta to San Francisco “because I wanted to do something involving musical entrepreneurship and wanted to be surrounded by the tech in Silicon Valley. I knew that the TAC program was an element of SFCM. All of that ultimately sold me on the conservatory.”Before coming to the school for TAC’s one-year professional studies program, Emily Pitts had earned a degree in software engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and then spent five years in the corporate world, pursuing a passion for writing music for film and video games on the side. Even before graduating, she has been hired at Facebook to work with its 360 Spatial Workstation team to design spatial audio for its video player.“It’s a marriage between my engineering and audio interests,” Ms. Pitts said.“In the real world, it can feel intimidating, like you’re trying to get into this boys’ club,” she added. “Working with so many other women and seeing your peers succeed and excel has been great.”Go to Home Page »",Music

"AdvertisementSupported by“When are the Wegos coming on?” the young boy sitting next to me asked his father. His impatience was reasonable enough. Here we were, five minutes into “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” gazing at a live-action prologue with Jackie Chan, a kid and a cat in a store full of exotic knickknacks.Soon enough, the Wegos awwived, and the latest installment in a nearly foolproof franchise was underway, a fast-moving mélange of brazen corporate promotion, winking pop-culture cleverness and earnest lesson-learning. I realize that makes this movie sound indistinguishable from nearly every other piece of family-targeted animated big-screen entertainment out there, and I’m sorry to report that the Lego movie enterprise has lapsed into intentional mediocrity.Garmadon, who wants to be a mayor, is a megalomaniac whose regular assaults on peace and normalcy are breathlessly covered by the news media and whose favorite pastime is firing his underlings. His estranged teenage son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster. But Lloyd, whose alter ego is the Green Ninja, works behind the scenes to check his father’s worst tendencies. Does every movie have to be a political allegory now? Can’t we just have fun?Not as much as we’d like to. The Lego figures are rendered with playful rigor; their limited movements and expressions generate some amusing sight gags. But the physical world they inhabit is more of a generic digital-cartoon space than a snapped-together environment. And the themes they explore are tired, cynical, sub-Disney bromides about family reconciliation and self-discovery.A dollop of mawkish sentiment is to be expected in this kind of movie. “The Lego Ninjago Movie” applies it in gluey globs, freezing the action so that Lloyd and Garmadon can work out their issues. For whose benefit? Children are unlikely to be captivated by this unconvincing melodrama of abandonment and reconciliation, and adults will be moved by it only because we’re hopeless crybabies.“She’s a girl and a ninja! Can she have it all?” a voice-over asks sardonically, trying to make a self-conscious joke at the expense of the movie’s own imaginative limitations. “You fellas need to inform yourselves on where we’re at culturally,” the lady ninja retorts. It’s a good line, but also one that the writers and directors — fellas to a man — might have taken a bit more to heart. Or maybe they did, and this is just where we’re at culturally.Movie data powered by IMDb.comAdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Movie
"AdvertisementSupported byROME — Italian voters' love affair with Silvio Berlusconi may be waning, judging by the slumping fortunes of his Forza Italia party in recent elections.But Italians are invited to explore the politician's relations with women in a new film by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino.The director on Wednesday described his film ""Loro"" (Them) as neither pro- or anti-Berlusconi — but instead tries to contemplate the ""feelings"" of the now 81-year-old ex-premier and media mogul toward his wife, who later sought a divorce, citing his keen interest in very young women.""It is not an ideological film or a film that takes a side,"" Sorrentino insisted to reporters after he screened the film in a Rome movie house. ""On the contrary, it's just the opposite.""Instead, so far, what ""hasn't been emphasized was the dimension of the feelings that were behind the political man,"" he said.The director described his latest film as also exploring people's fear of old age and death. ""Berlusconi's fear of old age and death is the fear we all have,"" he said.Berlusconi, who served three terms as premier, cannot currently hold office due to a tax fraud conviction, so he couldn't run for a fourth term in March 4 elections. But he still leads the center-right political party he created in the early 1990s.Italians were fiercely divided when Berlusconi used his media empire as a springboard into politics. Detractors feared he wanted to use his political power to protect his business interests. Admirers saw him as a fresh, straight-talking, can-do figure after decades of byzantine politics yielding short-lived governments.Sorrentino's ""The Great Beauty,"" which won the 2014 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, described the decadent political environment in Rome. His 2016 ""Youth -- La giovinezza"" described aging men's struggle with dwindling sexual energies.His latest film probes the collapse of Berlusconi's second marriage, to Veronica Lario, and her disappointment at the unraveling of their relationship.The backdrop for much of the film is a Sardinian villa, and the film features decadent parties there with lots of single young women present as Berlusconi's guests. But the movie doesn't cover Berlusconi's notorious ""bunga bunga"" sex-fueled parties at his Italian mainland homes — or the related legal woes that plagued him.Berlusconi, who has insisted that those evenings with his guests were ""elegant soirees"" with clean-cut entertainment, was acquitted on appeal of paying for sex with an underage woman.Italian actor Toni Servillo plays Berlusconi in the film, which is divided in two parts: ""Loro 1"" and ""Loro 2."" The first part opened in Italian cinemas last week, while ""Loro 2"" opens May 10.One of Italy's most acclaimed theater and screen actors, Servillo has played another iconic Italian politician, former seven-time premier Giulio Andreotti, in Sorrentino's movie, ""Il divo.""While Andreotti was a man who ""moved through the palaces of politics as an introvert,"" Servillo said Berlusconi is an ""extroverted diva who puts himself at the center of the political scene...waiting only for the moment to come back"" to the center of politics.Italian newspaper ""Il Fatto Quotidiano,"" known for its anti-Berlusconi stance, said Sorrentino with ""Loro"" effectively ""sanctions the recognition in the (not only) Italian collective imagination of the end of a personality, who already belongs to this country's past history.""___AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Movie
"AdvertisementCompiled entirely from real Russian dashboard camera videos, the movie is an experimental assemblage with no overarching plot or recurring characters. Instead, common cultural character emerges from dozens of disparate sketches. As if he were assembling a collection of Russian scary stories, the director Dmitrii Kalashnikov makes the bizarre beguiling.A preview of the film.Early on, a dashboard camera captures a green light as it burns across the horizon. The men who witness the light as they’re driving debate if they’ve seen a comet or a crashing plane, but on video the flash looks alien, like a probe from a foreign and hostile universe. Even when the danger turns out to be terrestrial in nature, “The Road Movie” always retains this same senseless strangeness. With every cut to a different camera, a surreal episode unfolds with a new menace. A couple drives through a forest fire so hot, the flames appear purple. When they aren’t avoiding crashes, drivers are threatened with guns, sledgehammers and hatchets. Without explanation, a man jumps on the hood of a stranger’s car, beating the glass first with his fists and then with his head.Perhaps strangest still is that throughout the bedlam, the drivers rarely betray their shock. They are under constant siege, but the only crack in their collective stoicism is the reliance on cameras to capture the chaos. The camera offers no protection; it only provides a witness. Fortunately for audiences, it’s more pleasurable to witness anarchy than it is to experience it.Not rated. In Russian with English subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 7 minutes.Go to Home Page »",Movie

"AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsAt any given moment across a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., cruise ships speckle the horizon, their gargantuan bodies reduced to dots in the distance. I grew up near this beach, and most of the people I knew growing up had been on cruises. They would go away for a week or a weekend, drawn by the promise of escape, and return to land with bad sunburns, stories of small adventures and a few extra pounds. For these people, cruising was an occasional vacation. For Mario Salcedo, the subject of this Op-Doc, it’s his everyday life.I first learned about Mario through my grandparents, both of whom are avid cruisers. As several of their senior friends began to spend more time on cruises than on land, my grandparents became aware of an elite cabal of sorts within the cruising subculture: passengers scattered across different cruise lines who choose to live at sea permanently. One such passenger was Mario Salcedo, or “Super Mario” as the crew of the Enchantment of the Seas affectionately calls him. For the past two decades, Mario has been a full-time resident on Royal Caribbean Cruises, accumulating over 7,300 nights at sea.For nearly two decades, Mario had been living out of his suitcase, traveling extensively for his corporate job as the director of international finance at a multinational corporation. He spent more time in and out of hotel rooms scattered across Latin America than he did at his home in Miami. After working nonstop for nearly 21 years, Mario — burned out — decided it was time to pursue a lifelong goal: to travel around the world, without leaving home. In 1997, he quit his job, packed an even bigger suitcase and quietly disappeared from the lives of his friends and family to pursue a new life on the open water.This past August, a film crew of me and four others joined Mario for five days on the Enchantment of the Seas. As we soon discovered, Mario lives a far different life from the one portrayed by both himself — as an unofficial public ambassador for Royal Caribbean — and the press.The Mario we followed was not living the fantastical dream life of a “cruising king,” as I’d seen him described. The Mario we found lives a life full of paradoxes: while he proclaims his independence from others, he surrounds himself with throngs of anonymous tourists, shaking hands and selling his lifestyle. I was determined to crack through what I perceived to be a facade. But as I floated dreamily across a sea of professional smiles with Mario, I realized that his facade had taken on a reality of its own, that his ongoing voyages to nowhere — and everywhere — provided an overwhelming sense of freedom perhaps not found on land.

"AdvertisementSupported byROME — Italian voters' love affair with Silvio Berlusconi may be waning, judging by the slumping fortunes of his Forza Italia party in recent elections.But Italians are invited to explore the politician's relations with women in a new film by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino.The director on Wednesday described his film ""Loro"" (Them) as neither pro- or anti-Berlusconi — but instead tries to contemplate the ""feelings"" of the now 81-year-old ex-premier and media mogul toward his wife, who later sought a divorce, citing his keen interest in very young women.""It is not an ideological film or a film that takes a side,"" Sorrentino insisted to reporters after he screened the film in a Rome movie house. ""On the contrary, it's just the opposite.""Instead, so far, what ""hasn't been emphasized was the dimension of the feelings that were behind the political man,"" he said.The director described his latest film as also exploring people's fear of old age and death. ""Berlusconi's fear of old age and death is the fear we all have,"" he said.Berlusconi, who served three terms as premier, cannot currently hold office due to a tax fraud conviction, so he couldn't run for a fourth term in March 4 elections. But he still leads the center-right political party he created in the early 1990s.Italians were fiercely divided when Berlusconi used his media empire as a springboard into politics. Detractors feared he wanted to use his political power to protect his business interests. Admirers saw him as a fresh, straight-talking, can-do figure after decades of byzantine politics yielding short-lived governments.Sorrentino's ""The Great Beauty,"" which won the 2014 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, described the decadent political environment in Rome. His 2016 ""Youth -- La giovinezza"" described aging men's struggle with dwindling sexual energies.His latest film probes the collapse of Berlusconi's second marriage, to Veronica Lario, and her disappointment at the unraveling of their relationship.The backdrop for much of the film is a Sardinian villa, and the film features decadent parties there with lots of single young women present as Berlusconi's guests. But the movie doesn't cover Berlusconi's notorious ""bunga bunga"" sex-fueled parties at his Italian mainland homes — or the related legal woes that plagued him.Berlusconi, who has insisted that those evenings with his guests were ""elegant soirees"" with clean-cut entertainment, was acquitted on appeal of paying for sex with an underage woman.Italian actor Toni Servillo plays Berlusconi in the film, which is divided in two parts: ""Loro 1"" and ""Loro 2."" The first part opened in Italian cinemas last week, while ""Loro 2"" opens May 10.One of Italy's most acclaimed theater and screen actors, Servillo has played another iconic Italian politician, former seven-time premier Giulio Andreotti, in Sorrentino's movie, ""Il divo.""While Andreotti was a man who ""moved through the palaces of politics as an introvert,"" Servillo said Berlusconi is an ""extroverted diva who puts himself at the center of the political scene...waiting only for the moment to come back"" to the center of politics.Italian newspaper ""Il Fatto Quotidiano,"" known for its anti-Berlusconi stance, said Sorrentino with ""Loro"" effectively ""sanctions the recognition in the (not only) Italian collective imagination of the end of a personality, who already belongs to this country's past history.""___AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Movie
"AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsAt any given moment across a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., cruise ships speckle the horizon, their gargantuan bodies reduced to dots in the distance. I grew up near this beach, and most of the people I knew growing up had been on cruises. They would go away for a week or a weekend, drawn by the promise of escape, and return to land with bad sunburns, stories of small adventures and a few extra pounds. For these people, cruising was an occasional vacation. For Mario Salcedo, the subject of this Op-Doc, it’s his everyday life.I first learned about Mario through my grandparents, both of whom are avid cruisers. As several of their senior friends began to spend more time on cruises than on land, my grandparents became aware of an elite cabal of sorts within the cruising subculture: passengers scattered across different cruise lines who choose to live at sea permanently. One such passenger was Mario Salcedo, or “Super Mario” as the crew of the Enchantment of the Seas affectionately calls him. For the past two decades, Mario has been a full-time resident on Royal Caribbean Cruises, accumulating over 7,300 nights at sea.For nearly two decades, Mario had been living out of his suitcase, traveling extensively for his corporate job as the director of international finance at a multinational corporation. He spent more time in and out of hotel rooms scattered across Latin America than he did at his home in Miami. After working nonstop for nearly 21 years, Mario — burned out — decided it was time to pursue a lifelong goal: to travel around the world, without leaving home. In 1997, he quit his job, packed an even bigger suitcase and quietly disappeared from the lives of his friends and family to pursue a new life on the open water.This past August, a film crew of me and four others joined Mario for five days on the Enchantment of the Seas. As we soon discovered, Mario lives a far different life from the one portrayed by both himself — as an unofficial public ambassador for Royal Caribbean — and the press.The Mario we followed was not living the fantastical dream life of a “cruising king,” as I’d seen him described. The Mario we found lives a life full of paradoxes: while he proclaims his independence from others, he surrounds himself with throngs of anonymous tourists, shaking hands and selling his lifestyle. I was determined to crack through what I perceived to be a facade. But as I floated dreamily across a sea of professional smiles with Mario, I realized that his facade had taken on a reality of its own, that his ongoing voyages to nowhere — and everywhere — provided an overwhelming sense of freedom perhaps not found on land. It is in that freedom that Mario has finally found his home.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Movie

"AdvertisementDuring his presidency, Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, watched 363 movies at Camp David. Spread out over eight years, it’s a pardonably large total, especially for two former film actors, a couple who retained show business as a frame of reference long after they’d gone into its professional cousin, politics. All their viewing of the era’s biggest hits probably kept the Reagans more connected to the country than watching four hours a day of cable news.Mark Weinberg, a young press aide detailed to Camp David on the weekends, would join a group of staffers in Aspen Lodge each time the president opened the door just before 8 p.m. Everyone would watch the films, and the staffers would also watch their hosts. More than 30 years later, with the former first lady’s blessing, Weinberg began writing this amiable book about the experience. “Movie Nights With the Reagans” is fluffed with a loyalist’s nostalgia, but it does offer entertaining glimpses of the first couple, and it may lure even Reagan nonenthusiasts to indulge in some nostalgia of their own.“Movie Nights With the Reagans” probably would have worked better as a half-hour oral history, but here it is, not unwelcome, if only to remind us that the role of the president can be played by a charming gentleman instead of a scoundrel.Thomas Mallon’s most recent book is “Finale: A Novel of the Reagan Years.”We earn an affiliate commission with each book purchase, which helps support our journalism at The New York Times.Go to Home Page »",Movie

"AdvertisementSupported byROME — Italian voters' love affair with Silvio Berlusconi may be waning, judging by the slumping fortunes of his Forza Italia party in recent elections.But Italians are invited to explore the politician's relations with women in a new film by Oscar-winning director Paolo Sorrentino.The director on Wednesday described his film ""Loro"" (Them) as neither pro- or anti-Berlusconi — but instead tries to contemplate the ""feelings"" of the now 81-year-old ex-premier and media mogul toward his wife, who later sought a divorce, citing his keen interest in very young women.""It is not an ideological film or a film that takes a side,"" Sorrentino insisted to reporters after he screened the film in a Rome movie house. ""On the contrary, it's just the opposite.""Instead, so far, what ""hasn't been emphasized was the dimension of the feelings that were behind the political man,"" he said.The director described his latest film as also exploring people's fear of old age and death. ""Berlusconi's fear of old age and death is the fear we all have,"" he said.Berlusconi, who served three terms as premier, cannot currently hold office due to a tax fraud conviction, so he couldn't run for a fourth term in March 4 elections. But he still leads the center-right political party he created in the early 1990s.Italians were fiercely divided when Berlusconi used his media empire as a springboard into politics. Detractors feared he wanted to use his political power to protect his business interests. Admirers saw him as a fresh, straight-talking, can-do figure after decades of byzantine politics yielding short-lived governments.Sorrentino's ""The Great Beauty,"" which won the 2014 Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, described the decadent political environment in Rome. His 2016 ""Youth -- La giovinezza"" described aging men's struggle with dwindling sexual energies.His latest film probes the collapse of Berlusconi's second marriage, to Veronica Lario, and her disappointment at the unraveling of their relationship.The backdrop for much of the film is a Sardinian villa, and the film features decadent parties there with lots of single young women present as Berlusconi's guests. But the movie doesn't cover Berlusconi's notorious ""bunga bunga"" sex-fueled parties at his Italian mainland homes — or the related legal woes that plagued him.Berlusconi, who has insisted that those evenings with his guests were ""elegant soirees"" with clean-cut entertainment, was acquitted on appeal of paying for sex with an underage woman.Italian actor Toni Servillo plays Berlusconi in the film, which is divided in two parts: ""Loro 1"" and ""Loro 2.""

"AdvertisementSupported by“When are the Wegos coming on?” the young boy sitting next to me asked his father. His impatience was reasonable enough. Here we were, five minutes into “The Lego Ninjago Movie,” gazing at a live-action prologue with Jackie Chan, a kid and a cat in a store full of exotic knickknacks.Soon enough, the Wegos awwived, and the latest installment in a nearly foolproof franchise was underway, a fast-moving mélange of brazen corporate promotion, winking pop-culture cleverness and earnest lesson-learning. I realize that makes this movie sound indistinguishable from nearly every other piece of family-targeted animated big-screen entertainment out there, and I’m sorry to report that the Lego movie enterprise has lapsed into intentional mediocrity.Garmadon, who wants to be a mayor, is a megalomaniac whose regular assaults on peace and normalcy are breathlessly covered by the news media and whose favorite pastime is firing his underlings. His estranged teenage son, Lloyd (Dave Franco), is ostracized and mocked for being the child of such a monster. But Lloyd, whose alter ego is the Green Ninja, works behind the scenes to check his father’s worst tendencies. Does every movie have to be a political allegory now? Can’t we just have fun?Not as much as we’d like to. The Lego figures are rendered with playful rigor; their limited movements and expressions generate some amusing sight gags. But the physical world they inhabit is more of a generic digital-cartoon space than a snapped-together environment. And the themes they explore are tired, cynical, sub-Disney bromides about family reconciliation and self-discovery.A dollop of mawkish sentiment is to be expected in this kind of movie. “The Lego Ninjago Movie” applies it in gluey globs, freezing the action so that Lloyd and Garmadon can work out their issues. For whose benefit? Children are unlikely to be captivated by this unconvincing melodrama of abandonment and reconciliation, and adults will be moved by it only because we’re hopeless crybabies.“She’s a girl and a ninja!

"AdvertisementCompiled entirely from real Russian dashboard camera videos, the movie is an experimental assemblage with no overarching plot or recurring characters. Instead, common cultural character emerges from dozens of disparate sketches.

The men who witness the light as they’re driving debate if they’ve seen a comet or a crashing plane, but on video the flash looks alien, like a probe from a foreign and hostile universe.

With every cut to a different camera, a surreal episode unfolds with a new menace. A couple drives through a forest fire so hot, the flames appear purple. When they aren’t avoiding crashes, drivers are threatened with guns, sledgehammers and hatchets. Without explanation, a man jumps on the hood of a stranger’s car, beating the glass first with his fists and then with his head.Perhaps strangest still is that throughout the bedlam, the drivers rarely betray their shock.

"AdvertisementSupported byOp-DocsAt any given moment across a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., cruise ships speckle the horizon, their gargantuan bodies reduced to dots in the distance. I grew up near this beach, and most of the people I knew growing up had been on cruises. They would go away for a week or a weekend, drawn by the promise of escape, and return to land with bad sunburns, stories of small adventures and a few extra pounds. For these people, cruising was an occasional vacation. For Mario Salcedo, the subject of this Op-Doc, it’s his everyday life.I first learned about Mario through my grandparents, both of whom are avid cruisers. As several of their senior friends began to spend more time on cruises than on land, my grandparents became aware of an elite cabal of sorts within the cruising subculture: passengers scattered across different cruise lines who choose to live at sea permanently. One such passenger was Mario Salcedo, or “Super Mario” as the crew of the Enchantment of the Seas affectionately calls him. For the past two decades, Mario has been a full-time resident on Royal Caribbean Cruises, accumulating over 7,300 nights at sea.For nearly two decades, Mario had been living out of his suitcase, traveling extensively for his corporate job as the director of international finance at a multinational corporation. He spent more time in and out of hotel rooms scattered across Latin America than he did at his home in Miami. After working nonstop for nearly 21 years, Mario — burned out — decided it was time to pursue a lifelong goal: to travel around the world, without leaving home. In 1997, he quit his job, packed an even bigger suitcase and quietly disappeared from the lives of his friends and family to pursue a new life on the open water.This past August, a film crew of me and four others joined Mario for five days on the Enchantment of the Seas. As we soon discovered, Mario lives a far different life from the one portrayed by both himself — as an unofficial public ambassador for Royal Caribbean — and the press.The Mario we followed was not living the fantastical dream life of a “cruising king,” as I’d seen him described. The Mario we found lives a life full of paradoxes: while he proclaims his independence from others, he surrounds himself with throngs of anonymous tourists, shaking hands and selling his lifestyle. I was determined to crack through what I perceived to be a facade. But as I floated dreamily across a sea of professional smiles with Mario, I realized that his facade had taken on a reality of its own, that his ongoing voyages to nowhere — and everywhere — provided an overwhelming sense of freedom perhaps not found on land. It is in that freedom that Mario has finally found his home.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Movie

"AdvertisementSupported by“The Last Movie Star” centers on Vic Edwards (Burt Reynolds), an alcoholic, washed-up actor who travels to a Nashville film festival to receive an honor without realizing that the event is a small-time, back-of-the-bar affair.

"AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia — Australian politics these days feels like a story in People magazine. Political journalism, indeed Parliament itself, has been reduced to a forum for rumors about sex.It all began in February with the sensational news that Barnaby Joyce, then deputy prime minister, had been having an affair with an aide, who is now pregnant. Eventually Mr. Joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench. But the government’s response to the scandal ensured it would linger on.This might seem like a straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within a government official’s office. But in truth it has meant that what might have been a footnote in Australian political history has instead set off the degradation of the country’s political culture.A consensual sexual relationship between a minister and a staff member has become a firing offense, like corruption or a conflict of interest. Every rumor of intra-office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and Parliament. Sex is now officially a matter of public interest.This could only have a deleterious effect on politics. And sure enough, that’s what has happened.But the truth is that the “morals lecture” came from Mr. Turnbull. Labor’s response throughout Mr. Joyce’s travails has been studiously amoral, focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds, or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of Mr. Joyce’s former employee to other ministerial offices. Only when the prime minister made the affair itself a civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make Ms. Cash’s comments a politically meaningful smear.The real problem here is not that Ms. Cash and Mr. Joyce exercised poor judgment. Politicians have been doing that for centuries. It’s that within this new political culture, Mr. Joyce could expect punishment for a consensual affair, and that Ms. Cash was saying something squarely relevant. Every political journalist now has a duty to explore sexual rumors, and politicians have a duty to investigate them.Mr. Turnbull’s attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned. And concern about sex and power in ministers’ offices is utterly reasonable. But we can’t regulate office sexual conduct in a way that doesn’t transform sexual behavior into a matter of public interest. Any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means.And that is before we even consider that to impose a ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members. And it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances.A policy that makes office sex a legitimate focus of journalistic and even political energy promises to do a major disservice in the long run. Australian politics might have become a little more sensationalistic through all this. And it has gotten a little smaller, too.Waleed Aly is a columnist and broadcaster and a politics lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics
"AdvertisementSupported byCritic’s Notebook“Italy and its thousand cultures should be the Silicon Valley of cultural heritage,” it sings, one of many flourishes among the party’s proposals for art institutions, churches and heritage sites. Unlike the League’s American cousins — Mr. Salvini is an avowed fan of President Trump — these Italian populists like to present themselves as defenders of public cultural institutions, and their “Make Italy Great Again” vision highlights museums as much as migration policy. For Mr. Salvini’s party, the nationalist project goes right through the history of art.Unlike in Germany, where the Nazi regime policed strict aesthetic boundaries, Benito Mussolini did not impose a style on Italy’s artists after he came to power in 1922. Culture was to be in the service of a rejuvenated state, but it could take any number of forms — from the abstraction of the second-generation Futurists to the classical figuration of painters espousing a “return to order.” How were these artists shaped by the politics of their time? And how, in turn, did these artists, many of whom eagerly supported the Fascist regime, participate in the construction of a new Italian iconography?A color-starved still life of bottles on a table by Morandi, who made a quiet peace with Fascism, appears just as it did in a 1921 exhibition. It gives onto the hideous mock-classicist marble busts of Adolfo Wildt, who stole the show at the 1922 Venice Biennale and who would go on to sculpt Mussolini with the intensity of a Roman emperor. We then see Di Chirico’s pictures of stringy, bare-bottom gladiators as they were displayed in a Paris apartment, and a Roman museum populated by gross, classicized athletes and nymphs.Instead of the false clarity of the white cube, “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum” gives us a plural, kaleidoscopic view of the decades of Il Duce. You watch helplessly as the avant-garde hardens into agitprop, and see how even the most stolid of styles could be complicit in horror.It also erases the distinction between elite exhibitions and popular manifestations — above all when you reach Fondazione Prada’s huge Deposito, or warehouse, where Mr. Celant projects dozens of installation shots from the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, which opened in Rome in 1932, for the 10th anniversary of the regime. This epic show, drawing nearly four million visitors, rewrote Italy’s political history as a hybrid of sacred ceremony and love affair with the leader. Cantilevered walls plastered with Fascist slogans and clippings from Il Popolo d’Italia, Mussolini’s newspaper, gave way to stylized statues of the regime’s brawny “new men.” It concluded with a “Shrine to the Fallen,” dominated by a massive crucifix and blinding light.Picking up where Fondazione Prada’s show ends is “Dawn of a Nation,” at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, a less ambitious exhibition that nevertheless offers an effective window onto Italian art amid postwar reconstruction. Unlike “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it limits documentary material to an initial gallery, where a newsreel montage takes us from the foundation of the republic in 1946 to the “dolce vita” of the 1960s.The past was not forgotten in this postwar age: Mimmo Rotella, whose canvases comprised multiple posters sliced in the technique known as décollage, found an old Mussolini placard beneath an advertisement for a swords-and-sandals epic film. But the economic boom of the 1950s occasioned a new freedom in Italian art. A beautiful gallery here unites two dozen paintings and sculptures of all white: a slashed monochrome by Lucio Fontana, a foam rubber canvas by Giulio Turcato, and multiple achromatic works by Piero Manzoni, whose white bread rolls, rabbit-fur balls and canned excrement mocked both artistic genius and rampant consumerism.By the late 1960s, the Italian avant-garde had again become explicitly political, though this time it spoke the languages of the left. In Rome, the Pop artist Mario Schifano painted boys toting hammers and sickles, when he wasn’t recording prog-rock or in jail on drugs charges. And up in Turin, a loose collection of young artists started to embrace humble, everyday materials to challenge artistic hierarchies, and eventually became known as Arte Povera. (The man who coined that term? A young Germano Celant, the curator of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum.”)“Dawn of a Nation” closes with one of the most emblematic works of Arte Povera: Giuseppe Penone’s “Rovesciare i Propri Occhi” (“Reversing One’s Eyes”), from 1970, in which the artist photographed himself wearing mirrored contact lenses, blinding himself and reflecting the world he usually saw back onto the viewer. The curators of “Dawn of a Nation” make the eyebrow-raising proposition that Mr. Penone’s photograph symbolizes “a nation gazing introspectively at itself and its history as it enters the period of critical tension” — that is to say, the violent years of the 1970s. That is a pretty desperate projection onto Mr. Penone’s intricate, sense-triggering art, and, when contrasted with the extreme precision of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it feels especially baseless.In any event, another work in “Dawn of a Nation” more explicitly encapsulates the tangled web of art and politics here. In Luciano Fabro’s “Italy” (1968), a steel cutout of the boot of Europe’s south hangs from the ceiling, but the wrong way up: a supporting wire stretches around Calabria, and Piedmont dangles down to the floor. It sways and swings like an air-dried prosciutto — or, indeed, like the body of Mussolini, hanging upside-down in a Milan square in 1945.Especially after March 4, as its citizens await to discover what sort of new government they will get, Fabro’s “Italy” feels familiar again, a portrait of a country both exquisite and hamstrung.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics
"AdvertisementSupported byMcLEAN, Va. — The campaign manager spoke about her candidate’s race with a veteran’s prepossessing self-assurance. Emma Brown is hiring staff, managing a budget, building out a schedule and studying voter data, block by block, in a Northern Virginia congressional district that will be one of the country’s hardest-contested in November.Her caffeine-fueled days are long — 16 hours is the norm — and so are the odds for her candidate, Lindsey Davis Stover, running in her first race.But Ms. Brown is undeterred. She has a strategy for her candidate to prevail in a “deeply tactical primary” through “hypercoordination” among events, digital strategy, mail, television and radio.Ms. Brown is only 24.They will have the potential to reshape a profession long dominated by men.This year, 40 percent of the campaign managers for Democratic congressional candidates are women, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In contrast, Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics, recalled excising data on female campaign consultants from a book she wrote in 2010 because the numbers were too small to be statistically reliable.“For years, women were the fund-raisers and the communications people,” said Anita Dunn, a Democratic consultant and former communications director for President Barack Obama. “But when it was the big-boy decisions, there weren’t women in the room.”That is changing. Ms. Brown alone is in regular contact with a half-dozen other young women managing congressional campaigns.Republicans have their analogues to Ms. Brown, though in smaller numbers.Becky Alery, 31, is managing her first campaign, for Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota. She said she was drawn to the candidate in part because of the strong women in his life and the many who serve in top staff roles on Capitol Hill.“I worked my butt off to get here. And I have had good support along the way,” she said, including from several men she said were mentors. “I really do think it is going to take women standing up for themselves and men supporting them.”While many 24-year-olds are finding their way in an entry-level job, Ms. Brown is managing a campaign staff, volunteers and a candidate who is 15 years her senior. She rarely sees her friends or family, she said.“They think I am insane,” Ms. Brown said. “I am doing something very different than most of them.”After Ms. Brown graduated in spring 2016 from Colby College in Maine, she packed her things and drove to Cleveland to volunteer for the Clinton campaign. She was quickly hired as a field organizer and walked precincts, talked to voters and worked on turnout. After the campaign, she assumed she would get a job in strategic communications or maybe journalism, but Mrs. Clinton’s loss made her believe she had to stay in politics and work to elect women.“I really revisited my values and thought to myself, I could move to a firm or go in another direction,” Ms. Brown said. “But if this is about to be as bad as we think it is going to be, I want to be able to look back and say I did everything I could when our country was threatened.”Ms. Brown’s success made an impression on Ms. Davis Stover, a former chief of staff to a Democratic congressman, who is running against Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable House Republicans.“I wanted a woman to run our race,” Ms. Davis Stover said. “I wanted Emma because she’s intelligent, she’s compassionate, she’s driven. I wanted someone with grit to walk through the fire.”Ms. Brown said young female campaign managers like her can “hold that space for other women.”“We talk a lot about how male managers come in, and there’s this respect,” she said. “Women managers come in, and they have to earn it.”Ms. Brown said she has felt the sting of sexism: Men have questioned whether she was really a campaign manager. She has been told she would have to wait her turn. And there has been the not-so-subtle “when did you graduate from college” question to discern her age.She uses that as motivation. “I feel very compelled to the front lines of electoral politics and electing women, in particular, in the Trump era,” Ms. Brown said.Ms. Dittmar, of Rutgers, said women who run campaigns are critical as “the key players in drafting a plan, drafting a message and a platform.”“The people you have at that table when making those decisions should be as diverse as the constituency that you are trying to persuade,” she said.For now, Ms. Brown is making those decisions in a makeshift campaign office in Ms. Davis Stover’s McLean, Va., home. A whiteboard in the dining room outlines the critical tasks. Volunteers and staff members work in the kitchen near the coffee maker. One recent night, Ms. Brown led a discussion of the five theories of power: legitimate, coercive, expert, reward and reverent.It was a “wise beyond her years” demeanor that Amy Walter, the national editor of The Cook Political Report, said she saw in Ms. Brown when she worked as an intern for her one summer.“She is not afraid to challenge people who have been in the business a long time,” Ms. Walter said. “You think a 23- or 24-year-old woman might feel pretty intimidated. And she just doesn’t back down.”Women have played prominent roles on campaigns for decades, including several on the presidential level, but managing a race was still more the exception than the rule.Ms. Brown said she and the other women running campaigns know that their opportunity was borne of Mrs. Clinton’s loss.“Hillary opened up this space for women,” Ms. Brown said. “If she had won, I don’t know if any of this would be happening. I don’t know if #MeToo would have happened. I would give my right arm to have won in 2016, but I am really grateful for everything that’s come out of it.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics

Ms. Brown alone is in regular contact with a half-dozen other young women managing congressional campaigns.Republicans have their analogues to Ms. Brown, though in smaller numbers.Becky Alery, 31, is managing her first campaign, for Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota. She said she was drawn to the candidate in part because of the strong women in his life and the many who serve in top staff roles on Capitol Hill.“I worked my butt off to get here. And I have had good support along the way,” she said, including from several men she said were mentors. “I really do think it is going to take women standing up for themselves and men supporting them.”While many 24-year-olds are finding their way in an entry-level job, Ms. Brown is managing a campaign staff, volunteers and a candidate who is 15 years her senior. She rarely sees her friends or family, she said.“They think I am insane,” Ms. Brown said. “I am doing something very different than most of them.”After Ms. Brown graduated in spring 2016 from Colby College in Maine, she packed her things and drove to Cleveland to volunteer for the Clinton campaign. She was quickly hired as a field organizer and walked precincts, talked to voters and worked on turnout. After the campaign, she assumed she would get a job in strategic communications or maybe journalism, but Mrs. Clinton’s loss made her believe she had to stay in politics and work to elect women.“I really revisited my values and thought to myself, I could move to a firm or go in another direction,” Ms. Brown said. “But if this is about to be as bad as we think it is going to be, I want to be able to look back and say I did everything I could when our country was threatened.”Ms. Brown’s success made an impression on Ms. Davis Stover, a former chief of staff to a Democratic congressman, who is running against Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable House Republicans.“I wanted a woman to run our race,” Ms. Davis Stover said. “I wanted Emma because she’s intelligent, she’s compassionate, she’s driven. I wanted someone with grit to walk through the fire.”Ms. Brown said young female campaign managers like her can “hold that space for other women.”“We talk a lot about how male managers come in, and there’s this respect,” she said. “Women managers come in, and they have to earn it.”Ms. Brown said she has felt the sting of sexism: Men have questioned whether she was really a campaign manager. She has been told she would have to wait her turn. And there has been the not-so-subtle “when did you graduate from college” question to discern her age.She uses that as motivation. “I feel very compelled to the front lines of electoral politics and electing women, in particular, in the Trump era,” Ms. Brown said.Ms. Dittmar, of Rutgers, said women who run campaigns are critical as “the key players in drafting a plan, drafting a message and a platform.”“The people you have at that table when making those decisions should be as diverse as the constituency that you are trying to persuade,” she said.For now, Ms. Brown is making those decisions in a makeshift campaign office in Ms. Davis Stover’s McLean, Va., home. A whiteboard in the dining room outlines the critical tasks. Volunteers and staff members work in the kitchen near the coffee maker. One recent night, Ms. Brown led a discussion of the five theories of power: legitimate, coercive, expert, reward and reverent.It was a “wise beyond her years” demeanor that Amy Walter, the national editor of The Cook Political Report, said she saw in Ms. Brown when she worked as an intern for her one summer.“She is not afraid to challenge people who have been in the business a long time,” Ms. Walter said. “You think a 23- or 24-year-old woman might feel pretty intimidated. And she just doesn’t back down.”Women have played prominent roles on campaigns for decades, including several on the presidential level, but managing a race was still more the exception than the rule.Ms. Brown said she and the other women running campaigns know that their opportunity was borne of Mrs. Clinton’s loss.“Hillary opened up this space for women,” Ms. Brown said. “If she had won, I don’t know if any of this would be happening. I don’t know if #MeToo would have happened.

"AdvertisementSupported byCritic’s Notebook“Italy and its thousand cultures should be the Silicon Valley of cultural heritage,” it sings, one of many flourishes among the party’s proposals for art institutions, churches and heritage sites. Unlike the League’s American cousins — Mr. Salvini is an avowed fan of President Trump — these Italian populists like to present themselves as defenders of public cultural institutions, and their “Make Italy Great Again” vision highlights museums as much as migration policy. For Mr. Salvini’s party, the nationalist project goes right through the history of art.Unlike in Germany, where the Nazi regime policed strict aesthetic boundaries, Benito Mussolini did not impose a style on Italy’s artists after he came to power in 1922. Culture was to be in the service of a rejuvenated state, but it could take any number of forms — from the abstraction of the second-generation Futurists to the classical figuration of painters espousing a “return to order.” How were these artists shaped by the politics of their time? And how, in turn, did these artists, many of whom eagerly supported the Fascist regime, participate in the construction of a new Italian iconography?A color-starved still life of bottles on a table by Morandi, who made a quiet peace with Fascism, appears just as it did in a 1921 exhibition. It gives onto the hideous mock-classicist marble busts of Adolfo Wildt, who stole the show at the 1922 Venice Biennale and who would go on to sculpt Mussolini with the intensity of a Roman emperor. We then see Di Chirico’s pictures of stringy, bare-bottom gladiators as they were displayed in a Paris apartment, and a Roman museum populated by gross, classicized athletes and nymphs.Instead of the false clarity of the white cube, “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum” gives us a plural, kaleidoscopic view of the decades of Il Duce. You watch helplessly as the avant-garde hardens into agitprop, and see how even the most stolid of styles could be complicit in horror.It also erases the distinction between elite exhibitions and popular manifestations — above all when you reach Fondazione Prada’s huge Deposito, or warehouse, where Mr. Celant projects dozens of installation shots from the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, which opened in Rome in 1932, for the 10th anniversary of the regime. This epic show, drawing nearly four million visitors, rewrote Italy’s political history as a hybrid of sacred ceremony and love affair with the leader. Cantilevered walls plastered with Fascist slogans and clippings from Il Popolo d’Italia, Mussolini’s newspaper, gave way to stylized statues of the regime’s brawny “new men.” It concluded with a “Shrine to the Fallen,” dominated by a massive crucifix and blinding light.Picking up where Fondazione Prada’s show ends is “Dawn of a Nation,” at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, a less ambitious exhibition that nevertheless offers an effective window onto Italian art amid postwar reconstruction. Unlike “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it limits documentary material to an initial gallery, where a newsreel montage takes us from the foundation of the republic in 1946 to the “dolce vita” of the 1960s.The past was not forgotten in this postwar age: Mimmo Rotella, whose canvases comprised multiple posters sliced in the technique known as décollage, found an old Mussolini placard beneath an advertisement for a swords-and-sandals epic film. But the economic boom of the 1950s occasioned a new freedom in Italian art. A beautiful gallery here unites two dozen paintings and sculptures of all white: a slashed monochrome by Lucio Fontana, a foam rubber canvas by Giulio Turcato, and multiple achromatic works by Piero Manzoni, whose white bread rolls, rabbit-fur balls and canned excrement mocked both artistic genius and rampant consumerism.By the late 1960s, the Italian avant-garde had again become explicitly political, though this time it spoke the languages of the left. In Rome, the Pop artist Mario Schifano painted boys toting hammers and sickles, when he wasn’t recording prog-rock or in jail on drugs charges. And up in Turin, a loose collection of young artists started to embrace humble, everyday materials to challenge artistic hierarchies, and eventually became known as Arte Povera. (The man who coined that term? A young Germano Celant, the curator of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum.”)“Dawn of a Nation” closes with one of the most emblematic works of Arte Povera: Giuseppe Penone’s “Rovesciare i Propri Occhi” (“Reversing One’s Eyes”), from 1970, in which the artist photographed himself wearing mirrored contact lenses, blinding himself and reflecting the world he usually saw back onto the viewer. The curators of “Dawn of a Nation” make the eyebrow-raising proposition that Mr. Penone’s photograph symbolizes “a nation gazing introspectively at itself and its history as it enters the period of critical tension” — that is to say, the violent years of the 1970s. That is a pretty desperate projection onto Mr. Penone’s intricate, sense-triggering art, and, when contrasted with the extreme precision of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it feels especially baseless.In any event, another work in “Dawn of a Nation” more explicitly encapsulates the tangled web of art and politics here. In Luciano Fabro’s “Italy” (1968), a steel cutout of the boot of Europe’s south hangs from the ceiling, but the wrong way up: a supporting wire stretches around Calabria, and Piedmont dangles down to the floor. It sways and swings like an air-dried prosciutto — or, indeed, like the body of Mussolini, hanging upside-down in a Milan square in 1945.Especially after March 4, as its citizens await to discover what sort of new government they will get, Fabro’s “Italy” feels familiar again, a portrait of a country both exquisite and hamstrung.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics

For Mr. Salvini’s party, the nationalist project goes right through the history of art.Unlike in Germany, where the Nazi regime policed strict aesthetic boundaries, Benito Mussolini did not impose a style on Italy’s artists after he came to power in 1922. Culture was to be in the service of a rejuvenated state, but it could take any number of forms — from the abstraction of the second-generation Futurists to the classical figuration of painters espousing a “return to order.” How were these artists shaped by the politics of their time? And how, in turn, did these artists, many of whom eagerly supported the Fascist regime, participate in the construction of a new Italian iconography?A color-starved still life of bottles on a table by Morandi, who made a quiet peace with Fascism, appears just as it did in a 1921 exhibition. It gives onto the hideous mock-classicist marble busts of Adolfo Wildt, who stole the show at the 1922 Venice Biennale and who would go on to sculpt Mussolini with the intensity of a Roman emperor. We then see Di Chirico’s pictures of stringy, bare-bottom gladiators as they were displayed in a Paris apartment, and a Roman museum populated by gross, classicized athletes and nymphs.Instead of the false clarity of the white cube, “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum” gives us a plural, kaleidoscopic view of the decades of Il Duce. You watch helplessly as the avant-garde hardens into agitprop, and see how even the most stolid of styles could be complicit in horror.It also erases the distinction between elite exhibitions and popular manifestations — above all when you reach Fondazione Prada’s huge Deposito, or warehouse, where Mr. Celant projects dozens of installation shots from the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, which opened in Rome in 1932, for the 10th anniversary of the regime. This epic show, drawing nearly four million visitors, rewrote Italy’s political history as a hybrid of sacred ceremony and love affair with the leader. Cantilevered walls plastered with Fascist slogans and clippings from Il Popolo d’Italia, Mussolini’s newspaper, gave way to stylized statues of the regime’s brawny “new men.” It concluded with a “Shrine to the Fallen,” dominated by a massive crucifix and blinding light.Picking up where Fondazione Prada’s show ends is “Dawn of a Nation,” at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, a less ambitious exhibition that nevertheless offers an effective window onto Italian art amid postwar reconstruction. Unlike “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it limits documentary material to an initial gallery, where a newsreel montage takes us from the foundation of the republic in 1946 to the “dolce vita” of the 1960s.The past was not forgotten in this postwar age: Mimmo Rotella, whose canvases comprised multiple posters sliced in the technique known as décollage, found an old Mussolini placard beneath an advertisement for a swords-and-sandals epic film. But the economic boom of the 1950s occasioned a new freedom in Italian art. A beautiful gallery here unites two dozen paintings and sculptures of all white: a slashed monochrome by Lucio Fontana, a foam rubber canvas by Giulio Turcato, and multiple achromatic works by Piero Manzoni, whose white bread rolls, rabbit-fur balls and canned excrement mocked both artistic genius and rampant consumerism.By the late 1960s, the Italian avant-garde had again become explicitly political, though this time it spoke the languages of the left. In Rome, the Pop artist Mario Schifano painted boys toting hammers and sickles, when he wasn’t recording prog-rock or in jail on drugs charges. And up in Turin, a loose collection of young artists started to embrace humble, everyday materials to challenge artistic hierarchies, and eventually became known as Arte Povera. (The man who coined that term? A young Germano Celant, the curator of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum.”)“Dawn of a Nation” closes with one of the most emblematic works of Arte Povera: Giuseppe Penone’s “Rovesciare i Propri Occhi” (“Reversing One’s Eyes”), from 1970, in which the artist photographed himself wearing mirrored contact lenses, blinding himself and reflecting the world he usually saw back onto the viewer. The curators of “Dawn of a Nation” make the eyebrow-raising proposition that Mr. Penone’s photograph symbolizes “a nation gazing introspectively at itself and its history as it enters the period of critical tension” — that is to say, the violent years of the 1970s. That is a pretty desperate projection onto Mr. Penone’s intricate, sense-triggering art, and, when contrasted with the extreme precision of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it feels especially baseless.In any event, another work in “Dawn of a Nation” more explicitly encapsulates the tangled web of art and politics here. In Luciano Fabro’s “Italy” (1968), a steel cutout of the boot of Europe’s south hangs from the ceiling, but the wrong way up: a supporting wire stretches around Calabria, and Piedmont dangles down to the floor. It sways and swings like an air-dried prosciutto — or, indeed, like the body of Mussolini, hanging upside-down in a Milan square in 1945.Especially after March 4, as its citizens await to discover what sort of new government they will get, Fabro’s “Italy” feels familiar again, a portrait of a country both exquisite and hamstrung.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics
"AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia — Australian politics these days feels like a story in People magazine. Political journalism, indeed Parliament itself, has been reduced to a forum for rumors about sex.It all began in February with the sensational news that Barnaby Joyce, then deputy prime minister, had been having an affair with an aide, who is now pregnant. Eventually Mr. Joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench. But the government’s response to the scandal ensured it would linger on.This might seem like a straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within a government official’s office. But in truth it has meant that what might have been a footnote in Australian political history has instead set off the degradation of the country’s political culture.A consensual sexual relationship between a minister and a staff member has become a firing offense, like corruption or a conflict of interest. Every rumor of intra-office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and Parliament. Sex is now officially a matter of public interest.This could only have a deleterious effect on politics. And sure enough, that’s what has happened.But the truth is that the “morals lecture” came from Mr. Turnbull. Labor’s response throughout Mr. Joyce’s travails has been studiously amoral, focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds, or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of Mr. Joyce’s former employee to other ministerial offices. Only when the prime minister made the affair itself a civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make Ms. Cash’s comments a politically meaningful smear.The real problem here is not that Ms. Cash and Mr. Joyce exercised poor judgment. Politicians have been doing that for centuries. It’s that within this new political culture, Mr. Joyce could expect punishment for a consensual affair, and that Ms. Cash was saying something squarely relevant. Every political journalist now has a duty to explore sexual rumors, and politicians have a duty to investigate them.Mr. Turnbull’s attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned. And concern about sex and power in ministers’ offices is utterly reasonable. But we can’t regulate office sexual conduct in a way that doesn’t transform sexual behavior into a matter of public interest. Any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means.And that is before we even consider that to impose a ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members. And it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances.A policy that makes office sex a legitimate focus of journalistic and even political energy promises to do a major disservice in the long run. Australian politics might have become a little more sensationalistic through all this.

"AdvertisementSupported byMcLEAN, Va. — The campaign manager spoke about her candidate’s race with a veteran’s prepossessing self-assurance. Emma Brown is hiring staff, managing a budget, building out a schedule and studying voter data, block by block, in a Northern Virginia congressional district that will be one of the country’s hardest-contested in November.Her caffeine-fueled days are long — 16 hours is the norm — and so are the odds for her candidate, Lindsey Davis Stover, running in her first race.But Ms. Brown is undeterred. She has a strategy for her candidate to prevail in a “deeply tactical primary” through “hypercoordination” among events, digital strategy, mail, television and radio.Ms. Brown is only 24.They will have the potential to reshape a profession long dominated by men.This year, 40 percent of the campaign managers for Democratic congressional candidates are women, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In contrast, Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics, recalled excising data on female campaign consultants from a book she wrote in 2010 because the numbers were too small to be statistically reliable.“For years, women were the fund-raisers and the communications people,” said Anita Dunn, a Democratic consultant and former communications director for President Barack Obama. “But when it was the big-boy decisions, there weren’t women in the room.”That is changing. Ms. Brown alone is in regular contact with a half-dozen other young women managing congressional campaigns.Republicans have their analogues to Ms. Brown, though in smaller numbers.Becky Alery, 31, is managing her first campaign, for Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota. She said she was drawn to the candidate in part because of the strong women in his life and the many who serve in top staff roles on Capitol Hill.“I worked my butt off to get here. And I have had good support along the way,” she said, including from several men she said were mentors. “I really do think it is going to take women standing up for themselves and men supporting them.”While many 24-year-olds are finding their way in an entry-level job, Ms. Brown is managing a campaign staff, volunteers and a candidate who is 15 years her senior. She rarely sees her friends or family, she said.“They think I am insane,” Ms. Brown said. “I am doing something very different than most of them.”After Ms. Brown graduated in spring 2016 from Colby College in Maine, she packed her things and drove to Cleveland to volunteer for the Clinton campaign. She was quickly hired as a field organizer and walked precincts, talked to voters and worked on turnout. After the campaign, she assumed she would get a job in strategic communications or maybe journalism, but Mrs. Clinton’s loss made her believe she had to stay in politics and work to elect women.“I really revisited my values and thought to myself, I could move to a firm or go in another direction,” Ms. Brown said. “But if this is about to be as bad as we think it is going to be, I want to be able to look back and say I did everything I could when our country was threatened.”Ms. Brown’s success made an impression on Ms. Davis Stover, a former chief of staff to a Democratic congressman, who is running against Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable House Republicans.“I wanted a woman to run our race,” Ms. Davis Stover said. “I wanted Emma because she’s intelligent, she’s compassionate, she’s driven. I wanted someone with grit to walk through the fire.”Ms. Brown said young female campaign managers like her can “hold that space for other women.”“We talk a lot about how male managers come in, and there’s this respect,” she said. “Women managers come in, and they have to earn it.”Ms. Brown said she has felt the sting of sexism: Men have questioned whether she was really a campaign manager. She has been told she would have to wait her turn. And there has been the not-so-subtle “when did you graduate from college” question to discern her age.She uses that as motivation. “I feel very compelled to the front lines of electoral politics and electing women, in particular, in the Trump era,” Ms. Brown said.Ms. Dittmar, of Rutgers, said women who run campaigns are critical as “the key players in drafting a plan, drafting a message and a platform.”“The people you have at that table when making those decisions should be as diverse as the constituency that you are trying to persuade,” she said.For now, Ms. Brown is making those decisions in a makeshift campaign office in Ms. Davis Stover’s McLean, Va., home. A whiteboard in the dining room outlines the critical tasks. Volunteers and staff members work in the kitchen near the coffee maker. One recent night, Ms. Brown led a discussion of the five theories of power: legitimate, coercive, expert, reward and reverent.It was a “wise beyond her years” demeanor that Amy Walter, the national editor of The Cook Political Report, said she saw in Ms. Brown when she worked as an intern for her one summer.“She is not afraid to challenge people who have been in the business a long time,” Ms. Walter said. “You think a 23- or 24-year-old woman might feel pretty intimidated. And she just doesn’t back down.”Women have played prominent roles on campaigns for decades, including several on the presidential level, but managing a race was still more the exception than the rule.Ms. Brown said she and the other women running campaigns know that their opportunity was borne of Mrs. Clinton’s loss.“Hillary opened up this space for women,” Ms. Brown said. “If she had won, I don’t know if any of this would be happening. I don’t know if #MeToo would have happened. I would give my right arm to have won in 2016, but I am really grateful for everything that’s come out of it.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics

You watch helplessly as the avant-garde hardens into agitprop, and see how even the most stolid of styles could be complicit in horror.It also erases the distinction between elite exhibitions and popular manifestations — above all when you reach Fondazione Prada’s huge Deposito, or warehouse, where Mr. Celant projects dozens of installation shots from the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, which opened in Rome in 1932, for the 10th anniversary of the regime. This epic show, drawing nearly four million visitors, rewrote Italy’s political history as a hybrid of sacred ceremony and love affair with the leader. Cantilevered walls plastered with Fascist slogans and clippings from Il Popolo d’Italia, Mussolini’s newspaper, gave way to stylized statues of the regime’s brawny “new men.” It concluded with a “Shrine to the Fallen,” dominated by a massive crucifix and blinding light.Picking up where Fondazione Prada’s show ends is “Dawn of a Nation,” at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, a less ambitious exhibition that nevertheless offers an effective window onto Italian art amid postwar reconstruction. Unlike “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it limits documentary material to an initial gallery, where a newsreel montage takes us from the foundation of the republic in 1946 to the “dolce vita” of the 1960s.The past was not forgotten in this postwar age: Mimmo Rotella, whose canvases comprised multiple posters sliced in the technique known as décollage, found an old Mussolini placard beneath an advertisement for a swords-and-sandals epic film. But the economic boom of the 1950s occasioned a new freedom in Italian art. A beautiful gallery here unites two dozen paintings and sculptures of all white: a slashed monochrome by Lucio Fontana, a foam rubber canvas by Giulio Turcato, and multiple achromatic works by Piero Manzoni, whose white bread rolls, rabbit-fur balls and canned excrement mocked both artistic genius and rampant consumerism.By the late 1960s, the Italian avant-garde had again become explicitly political, though this time it spoke the languages of the left. In Rome, the Pop artist Mario Schifano painted boys toting hammers and sickles, when he wasn’t recording prog-rock or in jail on drugs charges. And up in Turin, a loose collection of young artists started to embrace humble, everyday materials to challenge artistic hierarchies, and eventually became known as Arte Povera. (The man who coined that term? A young Germano Celant, the curator of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum.”)“Dawn of a Nation” closes with one of the most emblematic works of Arte Povera: Giuseppe Penone’s “Rovesciare i Propri Occhi” (“Reversing One’s Eyes”), from 1970, in which the artist photographed himself wearing mirrored contact lenses, blinding himself and reflecting the world he usually saw back onto the viewer. The curators of “Dawn of a Nation” make the eyebrow-raising proposition that Mr. Penone’s photograph symbolizes “a nation gazing introspectively at itself and its history as it enters the period of critical tension” — that is to say, the violent years of the 1970s. That is a pretty desperate projection onto Mr. Penone’s intricate, sense-triggering art, and, when contrasted with the extreme precision of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it feels especially baseless.AdvertisementIn any event, another work in “Dawn of a Nation” more explicitly encapsulates the tangled web of art and politics here. In Luciano Fabro’s “Italy” (1968), a steel cutout of the boot of Europe’s south hangs from the ceiling, but the wrong way up: a supporting wire stretches around Calabria, and Piedmont dangles down to the floor. It sways and swings like an air-dried prosciutto — or, indeed, like the body of Mussolini, hanging upside-down in a Milan square in 1945.Especially after March 4, as its citizens await to discover what sort of new government they will get, Fabro’s “Italy” feels familiar again, a portrait of a country both exquisite and hamstrung.Go to Home Page »",Politics

"AdvertisementMcLEAN, Va. — The campaign manager spoke about her candidate’s race with a veteran’s prepossessing self-assurance. Emma Brown is hiring staff, managing a budget, building out a schedule and studying voter data, block by block, in a Northern Virginia congressional district that will be one of the country’s hardest-contested in November.Her caffeine-fueled days are long — 16 hours is the norm — and so are the odds for her candidate, Lindsey Davis Stover, running in her first race.But Ms. Brown is undeterred. She has a strategy for her candidate to prevail in a “deeply tactical primary” through “hypercoordination” among events, digital strategy, mail, television and radio.Ms. Brown is only 24.AdvertisementThey will have the potential to reshape a profession long dominated by men.This year, 40 percent of the campaign managers for Democratic congressional candidates are women, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In contrast, Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics, recalled excising data on female campaign consultants from a book she wrote in 2010 because the numbers were too small to be statistically reliable.Advertisement“For years, women were the fund-raisers and the communications people,” said Anita Dunn, a Democratic consultant and former communications director for President Barack Obama. “But when it was the big-boy decisions, there weren’t women in the room.”That is changing. Ms. Brown alone is in regular contact with a half-dozen other young women managing congressional campaigns.Republicans have their analogues to Ms. Brown, though in smaller numbers.Becky Alery, 31, is managing her first campaign, for Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota. She said she was drawn to the candidate in part because of the strong women in his life and the many who serve in top staff roles on Capitol Hill.“I worked my butt off to get here. And I have had good support along the way,” she said, including from several men she said were mentors. “I really do think it is going to take women standing up for themselves and men supporting them.”While many 24-year-olds are finding their way in an entry-level job, Ms. Brown is managing a campaign staff, volunteers and a candidate who is 15 years her senior. She rarely sees her friends or family, she said.“They think I am insane,” Ms. Brown said. “I am doing something very different than most of them.”After Ms. Brown graduated in spring 2016 from Colby College in Maine, she packed her things and drove to Cleveland to volunteer for the Clinton campaign. She was quickly hired as a field organizer and walked precincts, talked to voters and worked on turnout. After the campaign, she assumed she would get a job in strategic communications or maybe journalism, but Mrs. Clinton’s loss made her believe she had to stay in politics and work to elect women.Advertisement“I really revisited my values and thought to myself, I could move to a firm or go in another direction,” Ms. Brown said. “But if this is about to be as bad as we think it is going to be, I want to be able to look back and say I did everything I could when our country was threatened.”Ms. Brown’s success made an impression on Ms. Davis Stover, a former chief of staff to a Democratic congressman, who is running against Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable House Republicans.“I wanted a woman to run our race,” Ms. Davis Stover said. “I wanted Emma because she’s intelligent, she’s compassionate, she’s driven. I wanted someone with grit to walk through the fire.”Ms. Brown said young female campaign managers like her can “hold that space for other women.”“We talk a lot about how male managers come in, and there’s this respect,” she said. “Women managers come in, and they have to earn it.”Ms. Brown said she has felt the sting of sexism: Men have questioned whether she was really a campaign manager. She has been told she would have to wait her turn. And there has been the not-so-subtle “when did you graduate from college” question to discern her age.She uses that as motivation. “I feel very compelled to the front lines of electoral politics and electing women, in particular, in the Trump era,” Ms. Brown said.Ms. Dittmar, of Rutgers, said women who run campaigns are critical as “the key players in drafting a plan, drafting a message and a platform.”Advertisement“The people you have at that table when making those decisions should be as diverse as the constituency that you are trying to persuade,” she said.For now, Ms. Brown is making those decisions in a makeshift campaign office in Ms. Davis Stover’s McLean, Va., home. A whiteboard in the dining room outlines the critical tasks. Volunteers and staff members work in the kitchen near the coffee maker. One recent night, Ms. Brown led a discussion of the five theories of power: legitimate, coercive, expert, reward and reverent.It was a “wise beyond her years” demeanor that Amy Walter, the national editor of The Cook Political Report, said she saw in Ms. Brown when she worked as an intern for her one summer.“She is not afraid to challenge people who have been in the business a long time,” Ms. Walter said. “You think a 23- or 24-year-old woman might feel pretty intimidated. And she just doesn’t back down.”Women have played prominent roles on campaigns for decades, including several on the presidential level, but managing a race was still more the exception than the rule.Ms. Brown said she and the other women running campaigns know that their opportunity was borne of Mrs. Clinton’s loss.“Hillary opened up this space for women,” Ms. Brown said. “If she had won, I don’t know if any of this would be happening. I don’t know if #MeToo would have happened. I would give my right arm to have won in 2016, but I am really grateful for everything that’s come out of it.”Go to Home Page »",Politics
"AdvertisementSupported byCritic’s Notebook“Italy and its thousand cultures should be the Silicon Valley of cultural heritage,” it sings, one of many flourishes among the party’s proposals for art institutions, churches and heritage sites. Unlike the League’s American cousins — Mr. Salvini is an avowed fan of President Trump — these Italian populists like to present themselves as defenders of public cultural institutions, and their “Make Italy Great Again” vision highlights museums as much as migration policy. For Mr. Salvini’s party, the nationalist project goes right through the history of art.Unlike in Germany, where the Nazi regime policed strict aesthetic boundaries, Benito Mussolini did not impose a style on Italy’s artists after he came to power in 1922. Culture was to be in the service of a rejuvenated state, but it could take any number of forms — from the abstraction of the second-generation Futurists to the classical figuration of painters espousing a “return to order.” How were these artists shaped by the politics of their time? And how, in turn, did these artists, many of whom eagerly supported the Fascist regime, participate in the construction of a new Italian iconography?A color-starved still life of bottles on a table by Morandi, who made a quiet peace with Fascism, appears just as it did in a 1921 exhibition. It gives onto the hideous mock-classicist marble busts of Adolfo Wildt, who stole the show at the 1922 Venice Biennale and who would go on to sculpt Mussolini with the intensity of a Roman emperor. We then see Di Chirico’s pictures of stringy, bare-bottom gladiators as they were displayed in a Paris apartment, and a Roman museum populated by gross, classicized athletes and nymphs.Instead of the false clarity of the white cube, “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum” gives us a plural, kaleidoscopic view of the decades of Il Duce.

"AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia — Australian politics these days feels like a story in People magazine. Political journalism, indeed Parliament itself, has been reduced to a forum for rumors about sex.It all began in February with the sensational news that Barnaby Joyce, then deputy prime minister, had been having an affair with an aide, who is now pregnant. Eventually Mr. Joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench. But the government’s response to the scandal ensured it would linger on.This might seem like a straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within a government official’s office. But in truth it has meant that what might have been a footnote in Australian political history has instead set off the degradation of the country’s political culture.A consensual sexual relationship between a minister and a staff member has become a firing offense, like corruption or a conflict of interest. Every rumor of intra-office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and Parliament. Sex is now officially a matter of public interest.This could only have a deleterious effect on politics. And sure enough, that’s what has happened.But the truth is that the “morals lecture” came from Mr. Turnbull. Labor’s response throughout Mr. Joyce’s travails has been studiously amoral, focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds, or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of Mr. Joyce’s former employee to other ministerial offices. Only when the prime minister made the affair itself a civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make Ms. Cash’s comments a politically meaningful smear.The real problem here is not that Ms. Cash and Mr. Joyce exercised poor judgment. Politicians have been doing that for centuries. It’s that within this new political culture, Mr. Joyce could expect punishment for a consensual affair, and that Ms. Cash was saying something squarely relevant. Every political journalist now has a duty to explore sexual rumors, and politicians have a duty to investigate them.Mr. Turnbull’s attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned. And concern about sex and power in ministers’ offices is utterly reasonable. But we can’t regulate office sexual conduct in a way that doesn’t transform sexual behavior into a matter of public interest. Any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means.And that is before we even consider that to impose a ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members. And it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances.A policy that makes office sex a legitimate focus of journalistic and even political energy promises to do a major disservice in the long run. Australian politics might have become a little more sensationalistic through all this. And it has gotten a little smaller, too.Waleed Aly is a columnist and broadcaster and a politics lecturer at Monash University in Melbourne.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics

"AdvertisementSupported byMELBOURNE, Australia — Australian politics these days feels like a story in People magazine. Political journalism, indeed Parliament itself, has been reduced to a forum for rumors about sex.It all began in February with the sensational news that Barnaby Joyce, then deputy prime minister, had been having an affair with an aide, who is now pregnant. Eventually Mr. Joyce resigned from his leadership post and retreated to the backbench. But the government’s response to the scandal ensured it would linger on.This might seem like a straightforward acknowledgment of the power imbalances within a government official’s office. But in truth it has meant that what might have been a footnote in Australian political history has instead set off the degradation of the country’s political culture.A consensual sexual relationship between a minister and a staff member has become a firing offense, like corruption or a conflict of interest. Every rumor of intra-office sex is now fair game for inquiry from the press and Parliament. Sex is now officially a matter of public interest.This could only have a deleterious effect on politics. And sure enough, that’s what has happened.But the truth is that the “morals lecture” came from Mr. Turnbull. Labor’s response throughout Mr. Joyce’s travails has been studiously amoral, focused on questions of whether his relationship had led him to abuse public funds, or whether the prime minister approved the transfer of Mr. Joyce’s former employee to other ministerial offices. Only when the prime minister made the affair itself a civil wrong by changing the office code of conduct for ministers did he make Ms. Cash’s comments a politically meaningful smear.The real problem here is not that Ms. Cash and Mr. Joyce exercised poor judgment. Politicians have been doing that for centuries. It’s that within this new political culture, Mr. Joyce could expect punishment for a consensual affair, and that Ms. Cash was saying something squarely relevant. Every political journalist now has a duty to explore sexual rumors, and politicians have a duty to investigate them.Mr. Turnbull’s attempt to deal with the power imbalances inherent between ministers and their staff was probably well intentioned. And concern about sex and power in ministers’ offices is utterly reasonable. But we can’t regulate office sexual conduct in a way that doesn’t transform sexual behavior into a matter of public interest. Any rules will be impossible to police except through the most corrosive and intrusive means.And that is before we even consider that to impose a ban like this is to dismiss the agency of the staff members. And it ignores the many perfectly sound relationships to come from such unbalanced circumstances.A policy that makes office sex a legitimate focus of journalistic and even political energy promises to do a major disservice in the long run.

"AdvertisementSupported byMcLEAN, Va. — The campaign manager spoke about her candidate’s race with a veteran’s prepossessing self-assurance. Emma Brown is hiring staff, managing a budget, building out a schedule and studying voter data, block by block, in a Northern Virginia congressional district that will be one of the country’s hardest-contested in November.Her caffeine-fueled days are long — 16 hours is the norm — and so are the odds for her candidate, Lindsey Davis Stover, running in her first race.But Ms. Brown is undeterred. She has a strategy for her candidate to prevail in a “deeply tactical primary” through “hypercoordination” among events, digital strategy, mail, television and radio.Ms. Brown is only 24.They will have the potential to reshape a profession long dominated by men.This year, 40 percent of the campaign managers for Democratic congressional candidates are women, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In contrast, Kelly Dittmar, a political scientist at Rutgers University’s Center for American Women and Politics, recalled excising data on female campaign consultants from a book she wrote in 2010 because the numbers were too small to be statistically reliable.“For years, women were the fund-raisers and the communications people,” said Anita Dunn, a Democratic consultant and former communications director for President Barack Obama. “But when it was the big-boy decisions, there weren’t women in the room.”That is changing. Ms. Brown alone is in regular contact with a half-dozen other young women managing congressional campaigns.Republicans have their analogues to Ms. Brown, though in smaller numbers.Becky Alery, 31, is managing her first campaign, for Representative Jason Lewis of Minnesota. She said she was drawn to the candidate in part because of the strong women in his life and the many who serve in top staff roles on Capitol Hill.“I worked my butt off to get here. And I have had good support along the way,” she said, including from several men she said were mentors. “I really do think it is going to take women standing up for themselves and men supporting them.”While many 24-year-olds are finding their way in an entry-level job, Ms. Brown is managing a campaign staff, volunteers and a candidate who is 15 years her senior. She rarely sees her friends or family, she said.“They think I am insane,” Ms. Brown said. “I am doing something very different than most of them.”After Ms. Brown graduated in spring 2016 from Colby College in Maine, she packed her things and drove to Cleveland to volunteer for the Clinton campaign. She was quickly hired as a field organizer and walked precincts, talked to voters and worked on turnout. After the campaign, she assumed she would get a job in strategic communications or maybe journalism, but Mrs. Clinton’s loss made her believe she had to stay in politics and work to elect women.“I really revisited my values and thought to myself, I could move to a firm or go in another direction,” Ms. Brown said. “But if this is about to be as bad as we think it is going to be, I want to be able to look back and say I did everything I could when our country was threatened.”Ms. Brown’s success made an impression on Ms. Davis Stover, a former chief of staff to a Democratic congressman, who is running against Representative Barbara Comstock, one of the most vulnerable House Republicans.“I wanted a woman to run our race,” Ms. Davis Stover said. “I wanted Emma because she’s intelligent, she’s compassionate, she’s driven. I wanted someone with grit to walk through the fire.”Ms. Brown said young female campaign managers like her can “hold that space for other women.”“We talk a lot about how male managers come in, and there’s this respect,” she said. “Women managers come in, and they have to earn it.”Ms. Brown said she has felt the sting of sexism: Men have questioned whether she was really a campaign manager. She has been told she would have to wait her turn. And there has been the not-so-subtle “when did you graduate from college” question to discern her age.She uses that as motivation. “I feel very compelled to the front lines of electoral politics and electing women, in particular, in the Trump era,” Ms. Brown said.Ms. Dittmar, of Rutgers, said women who run campaigns are critical as “the key players in drafting a plan, drafting a message and a platform.”“The people you have at that table when making those decisions should be as diverse as the constituency that you are trying to persuade,” she said.For now, Ms. Brown is making those decisions in a makeshift campaign office in Ms. Davis Stover’s McLean, Va., home. A whiteboard in the dining room outlines the critical tasks. Volunteers and staff members work in the kitchen near the coffee maker. One recent night, Ms. Brown led a discussion of the five theories of power: legitimate, coercive, expert, reward and reverent.It was a “wise beyond her years” demeanor that Amy Walter, the national editor of The Cook Political Report, said she saw in Ms. Brown when she worked as an intern for her one summer.“She is not afraid to challenge people who have been in the business a long time,” Ms. Walter said. “You think a 23- or 24-year-old woman might feel pretty intimidated. And she just doesn’t back down.”Women have played prominent roles on campaigns for decades, including several on the presidential level, but managing a race was still more the exception than the rule.Ms. Brown said she and the other women running campaigns know that their opportunity was borne of Mrs. Clinton’s loss.“Hillary opened up this space for women,” Ms. Brown said. “If she had won, I don’t know if any of this would be happening. I don’t know if #MeToo would have happened. I would give my right arm to have won in 2016, but I am really grateful for everything that’s come out of it.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics
"AdvertisementSupported byCritic’s Notebook“Italy and its thousand cultures should be the Silicon Valley of cultural heritage,” it sings, one of many flourishes among the party’s proposals for art institutions, churches and heritage sites. Unlike the League’s American cousins — Mr. Salvini is an avowed fan of President Trump — these Italian populists like to present themselves as defenders of public cultural institutions, and their “Make Italy Great Again” vision highlights museums as much as migration policy. For Mr. Salvini’s party, the nationalist project goes right through the history of art.Unlike in Germany, where the Nazi regime policed strict aesthetic boundaries, Benito Mussolini did not impose a style on Italy’s artists after he came to power in 1922. Culture was to be in the service of a rejuvenated state, but it could take any number of forms — from the abstraction of the second-generation Futurists to the classical figuration of painters espousing a “return to order.” How were these artists shaped by the politics of their time? And how, in turn, did these artists, many of whom eagerly supported the Fascist regime, participate in the construction of a new Italian iconography?A color-starved still life of bottles on a table by Morandi, who made a quiet peace with Fascism, appears just as it did in a 1921 exhibition. It gives onto the hideous mock-classicist marble busts of Adolfo Wildt, who stole the show at the 1922 Venice Biennale and who would go on to sculpt Mussolini with the intensity of a Roman emperor. We then see Di Chirico’s pictures of stringy, bare-bottom gladiators as they were displayed in a Paris apartment, and a Roman museum populated by gross, classicized athletes and nymphs.Instead of the false clarity of the white cube, “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum” gives us a plural, kaleidoscopic view of the decades of Il Duce. You watch helplessly as the avant-garde hardens into agitprop, and see how even the most stolid of styles could be complicit in horror.It also erases the distinction between elite exhibitions and popular manifestations — above all when you reach Fondazione Prada’s huge Deposito, or warehouse, where Mr. Celant projects dozens of installation shots from the Exhibition of the Fascist Revolution, which opened in Rome in 1932, for the 10th anniversary of the regime. This epic show, drawing nearly four million visitors, rewrote Italy’s political history as a hybrid of sacred ceremony and love affair with the leader. Cantilevered walls plastered with Fascist slogans and clippings from Il Popolo d’Italia, Mussolini’s newspaper, gave way to stylized statues of the regime’s brawny “new men.” It concluded with a “Shrine to the Fallen,” dominated by a massive crucifix and blinding light.Picking up where Fondazione Prada’s show ends is “Dawn of a Nation,” at Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, a less ambitious exhibition that nevertheless offers an effective window onto Italian art amid postwar reconstruction. Unlike “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it limits documentary material to an initial gallery, where a newsreel montage takes us from the foundation of the republic in 1946 to the “dolce vita” of the 1960s.The past was not forgotten in this postwar age: Mimmo Rotella, whose canvases comprised multiple posters sliced in the technique known as décollage, found an old Mussolini placard beneath an advertisement for a swords-and-sandals epic film. But the economic boom of the 1950s occasioned a new freedom in Italian art. A beautiful gallery here unites two dozen paintings and sculptures of all white: a slashed monochrome by Lucio Fontana, a foam rubber canvas by Giulio Turcato, and multiple achromatic works by Piero Manzoni, whose white bread rolls, rabbit-fur balls and canned excrement mocked both artistic genius and rampant consumerism.By the late 1960s, the Italian avant-garde had again become explicitly political, though this time it spoke the languages of the left. In Rome, the Pop artist Mario Schifano painted boys toting hammers and sickles, when he wasn’t recording prog-rock or in jail on drugs charges. And up in Turin, a loose collection of young artists started to embrace humble, everyday materials to challenge artistic hierarchies, and eventually became known as Arte Povera. (The man who coined that term? A young Germano Celant, the curator of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum.”)“Dawn of a Nation” closes with one of the most emblematic works of Arte Povera: Giuseppe Penone’s “Rovesciare i Propri Occhi” (“Reversing One’s Eyes”), from 1970, in which the artist photographed himself wearing mirrored contact lenses, blinding himself and reflecting the world he usually saw back onto the viewer. The curators of “Dawn of a Nation” make the eyebrow-raising proposition that Mr. Penone’s photograph symbolizes “a nation gazing introspectively at itself and its history as it enters the period of critical tension” — that is to say, the violent years of the 1970s. That is a pretty desperate projection onto Mr. Penone’s intricate, sense-triggering art, and, when contrasted with the extreme precision of “Post Zang Tumb Tuuum,” it feels especially baseless.In any event, another work in “Dawn of a Nation” more explicitly encapsulates the tangled web of art and politics here. In Luciano Fabro’s “Italy” (1968), a steel cutout of the boot of Europe’s south hangs from the ceiling, but the wrong way up: a supporting wire stretches around Calabria, and Piedmont dangles down to the floor. It sways and swings like an air-dried prosciutto — or, indeed, like the body of Mussolini, hanging upside-down in a Milan square in 1945.Especially after March 4, as its citizens await to discover what sort of new government they will get, Fabro’s “Italy” feels familiar again, a portrait of a country both exquisite and hamstrung.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Politics
"AdvertisementSupported bySportingI’ve come to think that Venmo, PayPal and the like might very well go out of business were it not for the annual three-week gambling festival known as the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion).But maybe that’s just me, what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country.My particular challenges aside, this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting.That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject.Credit, too, the escalation of athletes’ salaries, which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.)Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots.There’s no record of it, but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball — both, it should be noted, invented in England.Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.Baseball, one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication, “A Little Pretty Pocket Book,” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime,” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America, retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games.So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field, in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit, but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers, who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators, to shut down the pool boxes.This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby, in saloons and billiards halls, using runners to bring news back from the diamond.In fact, so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness, some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs, picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started, for obvious reasons, calling pool.As for this spring’s pools, expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account.

"AdvertisementNew York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation.Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much.There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend.AdvertisementIt was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.”AdvertisementThe tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency.To understand how this is possible, consider the balance sheet of the Atlantic Coast Conference, home of the 2017 national champions in football, Clemson, and men’s basketball, North Carolina. Its corporate sponsors include Toyota, Gatorade and Geico. When the conference filed its annual tax return for 2015, it reported about a quarter-billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities, as well as $147 million in other sports-related revenue. Its commissioner earned $2.9 million. The A.C.C. was a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax bill.But no taxes were owed. As the conference explained in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service, the Atlantic Coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on “academic excellence.”“The Atlantic Coast Conference,” it said, “seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student-athletes, while enriching their quality of life.”The magic word here is “educational.” Student-athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions. So college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes.There are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era. But they have weakened as big-time college sports has taken on the trappings of a profit-driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe. It is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights, sponsorships and donations from boosters.AdvertisementSo an escape hatch was opened for college sports. Over the years, the I.R.S. has periodically tried to close it. In the late 1970s, the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income. This ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the N.C.A.A. until the I.R.S. retreated, declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to a television audience.Other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers. In the 1990s, Congress did an end run around the I.R.S. and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising, which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax. It was not until the recently approved Republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course, eliminating a partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding $1 million. Over all, however, most athletics revenue continues to flow tax-free.That means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment, and the scandals that go with it, while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a Cayman Islands tax dodge. If President Trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore, he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home.Go to Home Page »",Sports
"AdvertisementFew would dispute the value to children of participating in sports, organized or otherwise. Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for children’s physical, mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline, cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time.When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s, we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams, made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure, there were occasional spats, but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun.But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of today’s parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them, according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in March.Today, adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports, and too often they get in the way of their children’s best interests, these experts say.AdvertisementAdvertisementAs Dr. Charles A. Popkin, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, said at the meeting, “Sadly, what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their children’s participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.”“Healthy competition is becoming unhealthy,” the orthopedics organization maintains. “More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport, and training year-round.” The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports “as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.”Too often, Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries.Dr. Mininder S. Kocher, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children’s Hospital Boston and another of the conference’s speakers, told me, “I’ve been doing Tommy John surgery” — an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players — “on more and more kids” who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices.In a prospective study of nearly 12,000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries, Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball, cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys, and specialization in running, swimming, soccer and volleyball, as well as cheerleading and gymnastics, increased the injury risk among girls.The injuries, reported by their mothers, all of whom are registered nurses, included stress fractures, tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., that require surgical repair.“Intense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists,” the orthopedic surgeons’ organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing, excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly.AdvertisementDr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they can’t play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.But even when not injured, youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out, sometimes from sports altogether, Dr. Kocher said.He emphasized that “parental influence on sports specialization can be profound” and counterproductive if it doesn’t mesh with the child’s goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport, the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic, of their own choosing.In his study of 303 college athletes, 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didn’t begin to specialize until they were nearly 15, on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens.“You want kids playing sports through life,” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.”It’s also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability.Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey.AdvertisementHis suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, they’re overdoing it.“A couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.”This is the first of two columns on youth sports safety.See More »Go to Home Page »",Sports

"AdvertisementSupported byQ. & A.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It’s long been a curiosity of mine, why people were so intense about their favorite team. I certainly had my favorites throughout my life. As a young person, it was Notre Dame football; and growing up in California, the Giants in baseball and the Warriors in basketball. Most of those teams fell away, but what became my one true obsession was the United States men’s national soccer team.Then I had kids — I have an eight-year-old and a five-year-old — and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them. It all came together three or four years ago. It felt like the moment, professionally and personally, for me to dive into this book. There are so many books that explore someone’s individual fandom, but those aren’t that accessible. If I’m not a Red Sox fan, I’m not going to read a book about a Red Sox fan. I thought, if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country, that was a more approachable way to analyze fandom.What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I talked to Susan Harter, a renowned child psychologist, about how kids receive their parents’ fandom. She told me that we shouldn’t be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence. This runs contrary to what we do. We put a baby in a Green Bay Packers onesie. This is what we see all the time, and we celebrate it, posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is. But a kid I wrote about, an Eagles fan, was just melting down in YouTube videos while the Patriots were beating his team.Harter said kids want to see the world in black and white. They want to divide the world into good and bad. And sports does that. But the kids don’t understand that the fact that their teacher is an Auburn fan doesn’t make them a bad person. They don’t understand that daddy’s going to be O.K. when his team loses. They lack perspective. They can’t say, “Well, it’s been a good season even though we lost this game.”Sometimes now I watch a game outside the home so my kids don’t see me yelling at the TV and see that it’s important to me. I don’t want them to make it important right now.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?Initially I wanted to have more fan-athlete engagement in the book, more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them. I thought that would make for good reading. And I did reach out to some athletes, but ultimately I concluded that part of fandom — “blazing” is what they call it, that troll behavior — while it exists, it felt like falling into a trap, just looking at the worst of fans. There is some bad behavior in the book, but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read “Superfans” in 50 words or less.A lot of people wonder about sports fans’ behavior. They might be husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, roommates, girlfriends, boyfriends. These people ask: “Why are they like that?” This book will open your eyes so wide to that behavior, and you’ll be able to tick off the reasons.This interview has been condensed and edited.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports

"AdvertisementSupported byQ. & A.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It’s long been a curiosity of mine, why people were so intense about their favorite team. I certainly had my favorites throughout my life. As a young person, it was Notre Dame football; and growing up in California, the Giants in baseball and the Warriors in basketball. Most of those teams fell away, but what became my one true obsession was the United States men’s national soccer team.Then I had kids — I have an eight-year-old and a five-year-old — and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them. It all came together three or four years ago. It felt like the moment, professionally and personally, for me to dive into this book. There are so many books that explore someone’s individual fandom, but those aren’t that accessible. If I’m not a Red Sox fan, I’m not going to read a book about a Red Sox fan. I thought, if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country, that was a more approachable way to analyze fandom.What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I talked to Susan Harter, a renowned child psychologist, about how kids receive their parents’ fandom. She told me that we shouldn’t be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence. This runs contrary to what we do. We put a baby in a Green Bay Packers onesie. This is what we see all the time, and we celebrate it, posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is. But a kid I wrote about, an Eagles fan, was just melting down in YouTube videos while the Patriots were beating his team.Harter said kids want to see the world in black and white. They want to divide the world into good and bad. And sports does that. But the kids don’t understand that the fact that their teacher is an Auburn fan doesn’t make them a bad person. They don’t understand that daddy’s going to be O.K. when his team loses. They lack perspective. They can’t say, “Well, it’s been a good season even though we lost this game.”Sometimes now I watch a game outside the home so my kids don’t see me yelling at the TV and see that it’s important to me. I don’t want them to make it important right now.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?Initially I wanted to have more fan-athlete engagement in the book, more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them. I thought that would make for good reading. And I did reach out to some athletes, but ultimately I concluded that part of fandom — “blazing” is what they call it, that troll behavior — while it exists, it felt like falling into a trap, just looking at the worst of fans. There is some bad behavior in the book, but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read “Superfans” in 50 words or less.A lot of people wonder about sports fans’ behavior. They might be husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, roommates, girlfriends, boyfriends. These people ask: “Why are they like that?” This book will open your eyes so wide to that behavior, and you’ll be able to tick off the reasons.This interview has been condensed and edited.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports
"AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisNew York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation.Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much.There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend.It was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.”The tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency.To understand how this is possible, consider the balance sheet of the Atlantic Coast Conference, home of the 2017 national champions in football, Clemson, and men’s basketball, North Carolina. Its corporate sponsors include Toyota, Gatorade and Geico. When the conference filed its annual tax return for 2015, it reported about a quarter-billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities, as well as $147 million in other sports-related revenue. Its commissioner earned $2.9 million. The A.C.C. was a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax bill.But no taxes were owed. As the conference explained in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service, the Atlantic Coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on “academic excellence.”“The Atlantic Coast Conference,” it said, “seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student-athletes, while enriching their quality of life.”The magic word here is “educational.” Student-athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions. So college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes.There are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era. But they have weakened as big-time college sports has taken on the trappings of a profit-driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe. It is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights, sponsorships and donations from boosters.So an escape hatch was opened for college sports. Over the years, the I.R.S. has periodically tried to close it. In the late 1970s, the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income. This ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the N.C.A.A. until the I.R.S. retreated, declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to a television audience.Other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers. In the 1990s, Congress did an end run around the I.R.S. and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising, which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax. It was not until the recently approved Republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course, eliminating a partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding $1 million. Over all, however, most athletics revenue continues to flow tax-free.That means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment, and the scandals that go with it, while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a Cayman Islands tax dodge. If President Trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore, he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports
"AdvertisementFew would dispute the value to children of participating in sports, organized or otherwise. Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for children’s physical, mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline, cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time.When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s, we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams, made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure, there were occasional spats, but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun.But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of today’s parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them, according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in March.Today, adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports, and too often they get in the way of their children’s best interests, these experts say.AdvertisementAdvertisementAs Dr. Charles A. Popkin, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, said at the meeting, “Sadly, what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their children’s participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.”“Healthy competition is becoming unhealthy,” the orthopedics organization maintains. “More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport, and training year-round.” The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports “as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.”Too often, Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries.Dr. Mininder S. Kocher, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children’s Hospital Boston and another of the conference’s speakers, told me, “I’ve been doing Tommy John surgery” — an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players — “on more and more kids” who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices.In a prospective study of nearly 12,000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries, Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball, cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys, and specialization in running, swimming, soccer and volleyball, as well as cheerleading and gymnastics, increased the injury risk among girls.The injuries, reported by their mothers, all of whom are registered nurses, included stress fractures, tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., that require surgical repair.“Intense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists,” the orthopedic surgeons’ organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing, excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly.AdvertisementDr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they can’t play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.But even when not injured, youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out, sometimes from sports altogether, Dr. Kocher said.He emphasized that “parental influence on sports specialization can be profound” and counterproductive if it doesn’t mesh with the child’s goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport, the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic, of their own choosing.In his study of 303 college athletes, 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didn’t begin to specialize until they were nearly 15, on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens.“You want kids playing sports through life,” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.”It’s also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability.Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey.AdvertisementHis suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, they’re overdoing it.“A couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.”This is the first of two columns on youth sports safety.See More »Go to Home Page »",Sports
"AdvertisementSupported bySportingI’ve come to think that Venmo, PayPal and the like might very well go out of business were it not for the annual three-week gambling festival known as the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion).But maybe that’s just me, what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country.My particular challenges aside, this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting.That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject.Credit, too, the escalation of athletes’ salaries, which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.)Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots.There’s no record of it, but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball — both, it should be noted, invented in England.Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.Baseball, one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication, “A Little Pretty Pocket Book,” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime,” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America, retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games.So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field, in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit, but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers, who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators, to shut down the pool boxes.This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby, in saloons and billiards halls, using runners to bring news back from the diamond.In fact, so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness, some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs, picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started, for obvious reasons, calling pool.As for this spring’s pools, expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account.

"AdvertisementSupported bySportingI’ve come to think that Venmo, PayPal and the like might very well go out of business were it not for the annual three-week gambling festival known as the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion).But maybe that’s just me, what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country.My particular challenges aside, this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting.That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject.Credit, too, the escalation of athletes’ salaries, which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.)Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots.There’s no record of it, but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball — both, it should be noted, invented in England.Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.Baseball, one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication, “A Little Pretty Pocket Book,” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime,” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America, retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games.So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field, in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit, but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers, who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators, to shut down the pool boxes.This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby, in saloons and billiards halls, using runners to bring news back from the diamond.In fact, so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness, some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs, picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started, for obvious reasons, calling pool.As for this spring’s pools, expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account.

"AdvertisementFew would dispute the value to children of participating in sports, organized or otherwise. Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for children’s physical, mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline, cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time.When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s, we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams, made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure, there were occasional spats, but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun.But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of today’s parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them, according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in March.Today, adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports, and too often they get in the way of their children’s best interests, these experts say.AdvertisementAdvertisementAs Dr. Charles A. Popkin, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, said at the meeting, “Sadly, what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their children’s participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.”“Healthy competition is becoming unhealthy,” the orthopedics organization maintains. “More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport, and training year-round.” The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports “as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.”Too often, Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries.Dr. Mininder S. Kocher, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children’s Hospital Boston and another of the conference’s speakers, told me, “I’ve been doing Tommy John surgery” — an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players — “on more and more kids” who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices.In a prospective study of nearly 12,000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries, Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball, cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys, and specialization in running, swimming, soccer and volleyball, as well as cheerleading and gymnastics, increased the injury risk among girls.The injuries, reported by their mothers, all of whom are registered nurses, included stress fractures, tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., that require surgical repair.“Intense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists,” the orthopedic surgeons’ organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing, excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly.AdvertisementDr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they can’t play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.But even when not injured, youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out, sometimes from sports altogether, Dr. Kocher said.He emphasized that “parental influence on sports specialization can be profound” and counterproductive if it doesn’t mesh with the child’s goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport, the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic, of their own choosing.In his study of 303 college athletes, 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didn’t begin to specialize until they were nearly 15, on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens.“You want kids playing sports through life,” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.”It’s also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability.Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey.AdvertisementHis suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, they’re overdoing it.“A couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.”This is the first of two columns on youth sports safety.See More »Go to Home Page »",Sports
"AdvertisementNew York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation.Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much.There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend.AdvertisementIt was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.”AdvertisementThe tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency.To understand how this is possible, consider the balance sheet of the Atlantic Coast Conference, home of the 2017 national champions in football, Clemson, and men’s basketball, North Carolina. Its corporate sponsors include Toyota, Gatorade and Geico. When the conference filed its annual tax return for 2015, it reported about a quarter-billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities, as well as $147 million in other sports-related revenue. Its commissioner earned $2.9 million. The A.C.C. was a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax bill.But no taxes were owed. As the conference explained in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service, the Atlantic Coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on “academic excellence.”“The Atlantic Coast Conference,” it said, “seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student-athletes, while enriching their quality of life.”The magic word here is “educational.” Student-athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions. So college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes.There are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era. But they have weakened as big-time college sports has taken on the trappings of a profit-driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe. It is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights, sponsorships and donations from boosters.AdvertisementSo an escape hatch was opened for college sports. Over the years, the I.R.S. has periodically tried to close it. In the late 1970s, the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income. This ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the N.C.A.A. until the I.R.S. retreated, declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to a television audience.Other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers. In the 1990s, Congress did an end run around the I.R.S. and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising, which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax. It was not until the recently approved Republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course, eliminating a partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding $1 million. Over all, however, most athletics revenue continues to flow tax-free.That means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment, and the scandals that go with it, while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a Cayman Islands tax dodge. If President Trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore, he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home.Go to Home Page »",Sports

He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens.“You want kids playing sports through life,” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.”It’s also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability.Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey.His suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, they’re overdoing it.“A couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.”This is the first of two columns on youth sports safety.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports
"AdvertisementNew York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation.Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much.There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend.AdvertisementIt was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.”AdvertisementThe tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency.To understand how this is possible, consider the balance sheet of the Atlantic Coast Conference, home of the 2017 national champions in football, Clemson, and men’s basketball, North Carolina. Its corporate sponsors include Toyota, Gatorade and Geico. When the conference filed its annual tax return for 2015, it reported about a quarter-billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities, as well as $147 million in other sports-related revenue. Its commissioner earned $2.9 million. The A.C.C. was a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax bill.But no taxes were owed. As the conference explained in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service, the Atlantic Coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on “academic excellence.”“The Atlantic Coast Conference,” it said, “seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student-athletes, while enriching their quality of life.”The magic word here is “educational.” Student-athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions. So college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes.There are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era. But they have weakened as big-time college sports has taken on the trappings of a profit-driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe. It is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights, sponsorships and donations from boosters.AdvertisementSo an escape hatch was opened for college sports. Over the years, the I.R.S. has periodically tried to close it. In the late 1970s, the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income. This ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the N.C.A.A. until the I.R.S. retreated, declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to a television audience.Other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers. In the 1990s, Congress did an end run around the I.R.S. and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising, which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax. It was not until the recently approved Republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course, eliminating a partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding $1 million. Over all, however, most athletics revenue continues to flow tax-free.That means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment, and the scandals that go with it, while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a Cayman Islands tax dodge. If President Trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore, he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home.Go to Home Page »",Sports

"AdvertisementSupported bySportingI’ve come to think that Venmo, PayPal and the like might very well go out of business were it not for the annual three-week gambling festival known as the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion).But maybe that’s just me, what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country.My particular challenges aside, this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting.That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject.Credit, too, the escalation of athletes’ salaries, which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.)Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots.There’s no record of it, but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball — both, it should be noted, invented in England.Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.Baseball, one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication, “A Little Pretty Pocket Book,” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime,” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America, retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games.So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field, in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit, but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers, who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators, to shut down the pool boxes.This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby, in saloons and billiards halls, using runners to bring news back from the diamond.In fact, so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness, some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs, picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started, for obvious reasons, calling pool.As for this spring’s pools, expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account.

"AdvertisementSupported byQ. & A.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It’s long been a curiosity of mine, why people were so intense about their favorite team. I certainly had my favorites throughout my life. As a young person, it was Notre Dame football; and growing up in California, the Giants in baseball and the Warriors in basketball. Most of those teams fell away, but what became my one true obsession was the United States men’s national soccer team.Then I had kids — I have an eight-year-old and a five-year-old — and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them. It all came together three or four years ago. It felt like the moment, professionally and personally, for me to dive into this book. There are so many books that explore someone’s individual fandom, but those aren’t that accessible. If I’m not a Red Sox fan, I’m not going to read a book about a Red Sox fan. I thought, if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country, that was a more approachable way to analyze fandom.What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I talked to Susan Harter, a renowned child psychologist, about how kids receive their parents’ fandom. She told me that we shouldn’t be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence. This runs contrary to what we do. We put a baby in a Green Bay Packers onesie. This is what we see all the time, and we celebrate it, posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is. But a kid I wrote about, an Eagles fan, was just melting down in YouTube videos while the Patriots were beating his team.Harter said kids want to see the world in black and white. They want to divide the world into good and bad. And sports does that. But the kids don’t understand that the fact that their teacher is an Auburn fan doesn’t make them a bad person. They don’t understand that daddy’s going to be O.K. when his team loses. They lack perspective. They can’t say, “Well, it’s been a good season even though we lost this game.”Sometimes now I watch a game outside the home so my kids don’t see me yelling at the TV and see that it’s important to me. I don’t want them to make it important right now.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?Initially I wanted to have more fan-athlete engagement in the book, more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them. I thought that would make for good reading. And I did reach out to some athletes, but ultimately I concluded that part of fandom — “blazing” is what they call it, that troll behavior — while it exists, it felt like falling into a trap, just looking at the worst of fans. There is some bad behavior in the book, but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read “Superfans” in 50 words or less.A lot of people wonder about sports fans’ behavior. They might be husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, roommates, girlfriends, boyfriends. These people ask: “Why are they like that?” This book will open your eyes so wide to that behavior, and you’ll be able to tick off the reasons.This interview has been condensed and edited.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports

"AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisNew York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation.Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much.There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend.It was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.”The tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency.To understand how this is possible, consider the balance sheet of the Atlantic Coast Conference, home of the 2017 national champions in football, Clemson, and men’s basketball, North Carolina. Its corporate sponsors include Toyota, Gatorade and Geico. When the conference filed its annual tax return for 2015, it reported about a quarter-billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities, as well as $147 million in other sports-related revenue. Its commissioner earned $2.9 million. The A.C.C. was a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax bill.But no taxes were owed. As the conference explained in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service, the Atlantic Coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on “academic excellence.”“The Atlantic Coast Conference,” it said, “seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student-athletes, while enriching their quality of life.”The magic word here is “educational.” Student-athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions. So college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes.There are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era. But they have weakened as big-time college sports has taken on the trappings of a profit-driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe. It is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights, sponsorships and donations from boosters.So an escape hatch was opened for college sports. Over the years, the I.R.S. has periodically tried to close it. In the late 1970s, the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income. This ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the N.C.A.A. until the I.R.S. retreated, declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to a television audience.Other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers. In the 1990s, Congress did an end run around the I.R.S. and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising, which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax. It was not until the recently approved Republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course, eliminating a partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding $1 million. Over all, however, most athletics revenue continues to flow tax-free.That means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment, and the scandals that go with it, while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a Cayman Islands tax dodge. If President Trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore, he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports
"AdvertisementFew would dispute the value to children of participating in sports, organized or otherwise. Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for children’s physical, mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline, cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time.When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s, we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams, made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure, there were occasional spats, but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun.But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of today’s parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them, according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in March.Today, adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports, and too often they get in the way of their children’s best interests, these experts say.AdvertisementAdvertisementAs Dr. Charles A. Popkin, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, said at the meeting, “Sadly, what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their children’s participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.”“Healthy competition is becoming unhealthy,” the orthopedics organization maintains. “More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport, and training year-round.” The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports “as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.”Too often, Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries.Dr. Mininder S. Kocher, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children’s Hospital Boston and another of the conference’s speakers, told me, “I’ve been doing Tommy John surgery” — an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players — “on more and more kids” who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices.In a prospective study of nearly 12,000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries, Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball, cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys, and specialization in running, swimming, soccer and volleyball, as well as cheerleading and gymnastics, increased the injury risk among girls.The injuries, reported by their mothers, all of whom are registered nurses, included stress fractures, tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., that require surgical repair.“Intense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists,” the orthopedic surgeons’ organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing, excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly.AdvertisementDr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they can’t play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured.Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.Invalid email address. Please re-enter.You must select a newsletter to subscribe to.View all New York Times newsletters.But even when not injured, youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out, sometimes from sports altogether, Dr. Kocher said.He emphasized that “parental influence on sports specialization can be profound” and counterproductive if it doesn’t mesh with the child’s goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport, the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic, of their own choosing.In his study of 303 college athletes, 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didn’t begin to specialize until they were nearly 15, on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens.“You want kids playing sports through life,” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.”It’s also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability.Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey.AdvertisementHis suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, they’re overdoing it.“A couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.”This is the first of two columns on youth sports safety.See More »Go to Home Page »",Sports

"AdvertisementSupported bySportingI’ve come to think that Venmo, PayPal and the like might very well go out of business were it not for the annual three-week gambling festival known as the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion).But maybe that’s just me, what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country.My particular challenges aside, this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting.That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject.Credit, too, the escalation of athletes’ salaries, which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.)Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots.There’s no record of it, but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball — both, it should be noted, invented in England.Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.Baseball, one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication, “A Little Pretty Pocket Book,” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime,” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America, retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games.So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field, in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit, but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers, who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators, to shut down the pool boxes.This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby, in saloons and billiards halls, using runners to bring news back from the diamond.In fact, so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness, some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs, picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started, for obvious reasons, calling pool.As for this spring’s pools, expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account. My brackets were busted quicker than you can say Sister Jean.Gary Belsky, the former editor in chief of ESPN The Magazine, is a co-author of “On the Origins Of Sports: The Early History and Original Rules of Everybody’s Favorite Games.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports

I certainly had my favorites throughout my life. As a young person, it was Notre Dame football; and growing up in California, the Giants in baseball and the Warriors in basketball. Most of those teams fell away, but what became my one true obsession was the United States men’s national soccer team.Then I had kids — I have an eight-year-old and a five-year-old — and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them. It all came together three or four years ago. It felt like the moment, professionally and personally, for me to dive into this book. There are so many books that explore someone’s individual fandom, but those aren’t that accessible. If I’m not a Red Sox fan, I’m not going to read a book about a Red Sox fan. I thought, if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country, that was a more approachable way to analyze fandom.What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I talked to Susan Harter, a renowned child psychologist, about how kids receive their parents’ fandom. She told me that we shouldn’t be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence. This runs contrary to what we do. We put a baby in a Green Bay Packers onesie. This is what we see all the time, and we celebrate it, posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is. But a kid I wrote about, an Eagles fan, was just melting down in YouTube videos while the Patriots were beating his team.Harter said kids want to see the world in black and white. They want to divide the world into good and bad. And sports does that. But the kids don’t understand that the fact that their teacher is an Auburn fan doesn’t make them a bad person. They don’t understand that daddy’s going to be O.K. when his team loses. They lack perspective. They can’t say, “Well, it’s been a good season even though we lost this game.”Sometimes now I watch a game outside the home so my kids don’t see me yelling at the TV and see that it’s important to me. I don’t want them to make it important right now.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?Initially I wanted to have more fan-athlete engagement in the book, more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them. I thought that would make for good reading. And I did reach out to some athletes, but ultimately I concluded that part of fandom — “blazing” is what they call it, that troll behavior — while it exists, it felt like falling into a trap, just looking at the worst of fans. There is some bad behavior in the book, but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read “Superfans” in 50 words or less.A lot of people wonder about sports fans’ behavior. They might be husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, roommates, girlfriends, boyfriends. These people ask: “Why are they like that?” This book will open your eyes so wide to that behavior, and you’ll be able to tick off the reasons.This interview has been condensed and edited.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports

"AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthFew would dispute the value to children of participating in sports, organized or otherwise. Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for children’s physical, mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline, cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time.When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s, we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams, made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure, there were occasional spats, but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun.But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of today’s parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them, according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in March.Today, adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports, and too often they get in the way of their children’s best interests, these experts say.As Dr. Charles A. Popkin, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, said at the meeting, “Sadly, what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their children’s participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.”“Healthy competition is becoming unhealthy,” the orthopedics organization maintains. “More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport, and training year-round.” The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports “as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.”Too often, Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries.Dr. Mininder S. Kocher, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children’s Hospital Boston and another of the conference’s speakers, told me, “I’ve been doing Tommy John surgery” — an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players — “on more and more kids” who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices.In a prospective study of nearly 12,000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries, Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball, cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys, and specialization in running, swimming, soccer and volleyball, as well as cheerleading and gymnastics, increased the injury risk among girls.The injuries, reported by their mothers, all of whom are registered nurses, included stress fractures, tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., that require surgical repair.“Intense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists,” the orthopedic surgeons’ organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing, excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly.Dr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they can’t play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured.But even when not injured, youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out, sometimes from sports altogether, Dr. Kocher said.He emphasized that “parental influence on sports specialization can be profound” and counterproductive if it doesn’t mesh with the child’s goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport, the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic, of their own choosing.In his study of 303 college athletes, 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didn’t begin to specialize until they were nearly 15, on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens.“You want kids playing sports through life,” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.”It’s also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability.Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey.His suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, they’re overdoing it.“A couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.”This is the first of two columns on youth sports safety.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports
"AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisNew York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation.Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much.There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend.It was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.”The tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency.To understand how this is possible, consider the balance sheet of the Atlantic Coast Conference, home of the 2017 national champions in football, Clemson, and men’s basketball, North Carolina. Its corporate sponsors include Toyota, Gatorade and Geico. When the conference filed its annual tax return for 2015, it reported about a quarter-billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities, as well as $147 million in other sports-related revenue. Its commissioner earned $2.9 million. The A.C.C. was a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax bill.But no taxes were owed. As the conference explained in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service, the Atlantic Coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on “academic excellence.”“The Atlantic Coast Conference,” it said, “seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student-athletes, while enriching their quality of life.”The magic word here is “educational.” Student-athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions. So college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes.There are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era. But they have weakened as big-time college sports has taken on the trappings of a profit-driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe. It is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights, sponsorships and donations from boosters.So an escape hatch was opened for college sports. Over the years, the I.R.S. has periodically tried to close it. In the late 1970s, the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income. This ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the N.C.A.A. until the I.R.S. retreated, declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to a television audience.Other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers. In the 1990s, Congress did an end run around the I.R.S. and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising, which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax. It was not until the recently approved Republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course, eliminating a partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding $1 million. Over all, however, most athletics revenue continues to flow tax-free.That means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment, and the scandals that go with it, while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a Cayman Islands tax dodge. If President Trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore, he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports

"AdvertisementSupported bySportingI’ve come to think that Venmo, PayPal and the like might very well go out of business were it not for the annual three-week gambling festival known as the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion).But maybe that’s just me, what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country.My particular challenges aside, this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting.That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject.Credit, too, the escalation of athletes’ salaries, which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.)Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots.There’s no record of it, but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball — both, it should be noted, invented in England.Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.Baseball, one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication, “A Little Pretty Pocket Book,” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime,” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America, retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games.So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field, in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit, but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers, who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators, to shut down the pool boxes.This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby, in saloons and billiards halls, using runners to bring news back from the diamond.In fact, so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness, some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs, picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started, for obvious reasons, calling pool.As for this spring’s pools, expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account.

"AdvertisementSupported byQ. & A.When did you first get the idea to write this book?It’s long been a curiosity of mine, why people were so intense about their favorite team. I certainly had my favorites throughout my life. As a young person, it was Notre Dame football; and growing up in California, the Giants in baseball and the Warriors in basketball. Most of those teams fell away, but what became my one true obsession was the United States men’s national soccer team.Then I had kids — I have an eight-year-old and a five-year-old — and started asking myself about fandom and how to introduce it to them. It all came together three or four years ago. It felt like the moment, professionally and personally, for me to dive into this book. There are so many books that explore someone’s individual fandom, but those aren’t that accessible. If I’m not a Red Sox fan, I’m not going to read a book about a Red Sox fan. I thought, if you wrote something that introduced different people from around the country, that was a more approachable way to analyze fandom.What’s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?I talked to Susan Harter, a renowned child psychologist, about how kids receive their parents’ fandom. She told me that we shouldn’t be introducing our kids to fandom until adolescence. This runs contrary to what we do. We put a baby in a Green Bay Packers onesie. This is what we see all the time, and we celebrate it, posting pictures of it and saying how cute it is. But a kid I wrote about, an Eagles fan, was just melting down in YouTube videos while the Patriots were beating his team.Harter said kids want to see the world in black and white. They want to divide the world into good and bad. And sports does that. But the kids don’t understand that the fact that their teacher is an Auburn fan doesn’t make them a bad person. They don’t understand that daddy’s going to be O.K. when his team loses. They lack perspective. They can’t say, “Well, it’s been a good season even though we lost this game.”Sometimes now I watch a game outside the home so my kids don’t see me yelling at the TV and see that it’s important to me. I don’t want them to make it important right now.In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?Initially I wanted to have more fan-athlete engagement in the book, more opportunities for athletes to confront the fans who often say critical things about them. I thought that would make for good reading. And I did reach out to some athletes, but ultimately I concluded that part of fandom — “blazing” is what they call it, that troll behavior — while it exists, it felt like falling into a trap, just looking at the worst of fans. There is some bad behavior in the book, but it felt too voyeuristic to keep highlighting these really extreme negative fans.Who is a creative person (not a writer) who has influenced you and your work?Persuade someone to read “Superfans” in 50 words or less.A lot of people wonder about sports fans’ behavior. They might be husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, roommates, girlfriends, boyfriends. These people ask: “Why are they like that?” This book will open your eyes so wide to that behavior, and you’ll be able to tick off the reasons.This interview has been condensed and edited.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports

"AdvertisementSupported bySportingI’ve come to think that Venmo, PayPal and the like might very well go out of business were it not for the annual three-week gambling festival known as the N.C.A.A. Division I men’s basketball tournament (estimated wagers this year: more than $10 billion).But maybe that’s just me, what with the many bracket pools I’m invited to join every spring and the associated entry fees I’m asked to payment-app-as-verb to various gambling enablers — I mean pool organizers — around the country.My particular challenges aside, this year’s iteration of March Madness and the Final Four is yet another reminder of America’s long-simmering and complex relationship with sports betting.That none of these developments has rallied much outcry or opposition reflects both an evolution and devolution of attitudes toward the subject.Credit, too, the escalation of athletes’ salaries, which makes the reward of taking bribes to throw games rarely worth the risk of getting caught. (It’s no coincidence that tennis and lower-tier soccer — whose competitors often earn little enough to be vulnerable — continue to struggle most with match fixing.)Gambling does not represent any kind of new threat to American sports. On the contrary, it’s a homecoming of sorts to sports’ roots.There’s no record of it, but it’s almost a certainty that as soon as the first pair of crook-wielding Scottish shepherds decided to see who could knock dried sheep dung closest to a rabbit hole — golf! — so, too, did a couple of nearby highland lads agree to wager on the outcome. Ancient Olympics, scholars believe, had betting scandals, involving bribetaking athletes throwing a wrestling match or foot race.More relevant and recent is the close connection between betting and two of the world’s oldest and most popular organized sports, cricket and baseball — both, it should be noted, invented in England.Betting was so integral to cricket’s modern provenance that the first rules books were concerned almost entirely with the adjudication of betting disagreements. Likewise, the earliest newspaper accounts of cricket matches focused a little on runs tallied and a lot on amounts wagered. Landed gentry and other moneyed types were especially fond of the new hobby.Baseball, one of the earliest known references to which (“base-ball”) shows up in a 1744 English publication, “A Little Pretty Pocket Book,” also began as child’s play but flowered as an adult activity. But America’s “national pastime,” which started evolving almost as soon as play began in North America, retained at least one strand of British sporting DNA: Yanks loved to gamble on it — and not just on the outcome of games.So fast were bets laid and so furiously did money change hands that serious gamblers congregated near the field, in sections referred to as “pool boxes.” Their coarse banter and unseemly behavior — imagine a stock trading pit, but with chewing tobacco and whiskey — forced many of the game’s organizers, who were interested in drawing families and other wholesome spectators, to shut down the pool boxes.This did nothing to curtail betting because the pool boxes simply reset nearby, in saloons and billiards halls, using runners to bring news back from the diamond.In fact, so closely did betting pools and pool boxes become associated with billiards that when sports-bar patrons took a break from this March’s madness, some doubtless turned away from the bank of TVs, picked up a cue stick and challenged someone to a game Americans long ago stopped referring to as billiards and started, for obvious reasons, calling pool.As for this spring’s pools, expect a frenzy of digital transactions once the 2018 tourney champ is crowned and winnings are distributed. Just don’t expect any money to wind up in my Venmo account. My brackets were busted quicker than you can say Sister Jean.Gary Belsky, the former editor in chief of ESPN The Magazine, is a co-author of “On the Origins Of Sports: The Early History and Original Rules of Everybody’s Favorite Games.”AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports
"AdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthAdvertisementSupported byPersonal HealthFew would dispute the value to children of participating in sports, organized or otherwise. Being physically active and engaged in friendly competition is widely acknowledged to be good for children’s physical, mental and social well-being. It can foster discipline, cooperation and camaraderie as well as a good time.When I was growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s and ’50s, we were free to play games and sports that we chose or devised. We picked teams, made the rules and enforced them ourselves. No officials monitored our activities and no adults oversaw or commented on how well or poorly we played. Sure, there were occasional spats, but we learned how to resolve them on our own and get back to having fun.But the concept of free play has since yielded to adult-controlled games and hopes for glory among many of today’s parents. The way youth sports is promoted in many parts of the country these days can be anything but good for the children who engage in them, according to leading experts who described their findings at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons in March.Today, adults are most often the organizers and enforcers of youth sports, and too often they get in the way of their children’s best interests, these experts say.As Dr. Charles A. Popkin, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Columbia University Medical Center, said at the meeting, “Sadly, what parents want and what parents hope to gain from their children’s participation in youth sports is often at a significant extreme to what the kids actually want.”“Healthy competition is becoming unhealthy,” the orthopedics organization maintains. “More and more young athletes under the age of 12 are focusing on just one sport, and training year-round.” The American Orthopedic Society for Sports Medicine defines specialization in youth sports “as engaging in a sport for at least three seasons a year at the exclusion of other sports.”Too often, Dr. Popkin and his associates at Columbia and medical centers elsewhere find themselves treating the fallout from early sports specialization when the participants develop overuse injuries.Dr. Mininder S. Kocher, pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children’s Hospital Boston and another of the conference’s speakers, told me, “I’ve been doing Tommy John surgery” — an elbow reconstruction procedure often associated with professional baseball players — “on more and more kids” who damaged their arms by pitching for too many hours in too many games and practices.In a prospective study of nearly 12,000 youngsters with highly accurate histories of sports-related injuries, Dr. Kocher and colleagues found that early specialization in baseball, cheerleading and gymnastics increased the risk of injury among boys, and specialization in running, swimming, soccer and volleyball, as well as cheerleading and gymnastics, increased the injury risk among girls.The injuries, reported by their mothers, all of whom are registered nurses, included stress fractures, tendinitis and knee injuries like tears of the anterior cruciate ligament, or A.C.L., that require surgical repair.“Intense and repetitive training can lead to pediatric trauma and may require surgery to young shoulders, knees, elbows and wrists,” the orthopedic surgeons’ organization reported. It noted that in children whose bodies are still growing and developing, excessive training in a single sport does not give them enough time to heal properly.Dr. Kocher said in an interview that children who grow up in the northern United States are more likely to become major league baseball players than kids from the South because they can’t play their sport year-round and are less likely to be injured.But even when not injured, youngsters pressured to become star athletes often burn out and drop out, sometimes from sports altogether, Dr. Kocher said.He emphasized that “parental influence on sports specialization can be profound” and counterproductive if it doesn’t mesh with the child’s goals and interests. If children are to be successful at a sport, the drive to specialize and succeed must be intrinsic, of their own choosing.In his study of 303 college athletes, 98 percent currently playing one sport had previously played another organized sport before college. They didn’t begin to specialize until they were nearly 15, on average. He noted that Mariano Rivera, considered the best closing pitcher in baseball history, had played soccer, his favorite sport as a youth, before focusing on baseball in his late teens.“You want kids playing sports through life,” Dr. Popkin said. “There are lots of benefits to later sports specialization, at some point in high school. The more sports kids play, the better they learn adaptability. They learn how to learn.”It’s also important, he said, for kids to cross-train by doing multiple sports so that “they develop whole-body skills like balance, quickness and core strength” that can enhance their overall athletic ability.Dr. Popkin said that with the exception of a few individual sports like gymnastics, tennis and fencing, kids do better if they specialize later. In his study of college athletes, only 18 percent reported specializing by age 12. Forty-five percent played multiple sports up to age 16, and there were no early specializers among those who played football, lacrosse or field hockey.His suggestions to parents: “Expose your children to as many activities as possible and support what they like. But if they’re doing more hours of a sport a week than their age in years, they’re overdoing it.“A couple of months of the year, encourage them to do something else. If they play soccer, they could switch off to tennis; if they play hockey, they could try the track team. Cross-training helps their bodies and can keep them from burning out.”This is the first of two columns on youth sports safety.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports
"AdvertisementSupported byNews AnalysisNew York University does not have much of an athletic program. But 70 years ago, it ran a profitable macaroni company, leading indirectly to a decision by Congress that college sports — if not a college-owned noodle business — should be exempt from taxation.Today, as the hugely lucrative football bowl season wraps up, colleges fear that the new tax law signed by President Trump could derail their gravy train — two provisions target coaches’ high salaries and booster donations tied to ticket purchases. But they need not worry much.There are no plans to start taxing television revenue and corporate sponsorships, two of the biggest income streams, which together transformed intercollegiate athletics into a multibillion-dollar business. Even with the legislative changes, collegiate sports remain largely tax exempt, the beneficiary of a public subsidy that is increasingly difficult to defend.It was left to federal prosecutors to issue a statement condemning the “criminal influence of money on coaches and student-athletes.”The tax-exempt nature of college sports is not the cause of these problems. Rather, it is rocket fuel for an engine that has escaped the gravitational pull of common sense and decency.To understand how this is possible, consider the balance sheet of the Atlantic Coast Conference, home of the 2017 national champions in football, Clemson, and men’s basketball, North Carolina. Its corporate sponsors include Toyota, Gatorade and Geico. When the conference filed its annual tax return for 2015, it reported about a quarter-billion dollars from broadcasting games for its member universities, as well as $147 million in other sports-related revenue. Its commissioner earned $2.9 million. The A.C.C. was a huge commercial success with income that would normally generate a huge tax bill.But no taxes were owed. As the conference explained in its filing with the Internal Revenue Service, the Atlantic Coast and its member schools are nonprofit charitable organizations that place an emphasis on “academic excellence.”“The Atlantic Coast Conference,” it said, “seeks to maximize the educational and athletic opportunities of its student-athletes, while enriching their quality of life.”The magic word here is “educational.” Student-athletes have always been considered unpaid amateurs engaging in extracurricular activities rather than profitable professions. So college sports is deemed part of the educational mission of schools and exempt from income taxes.There are specific and contentious interpretations of law that prop up this assumption in the modern era. But they have weakened as big-time college sports has taken on the trappings of a profit-driven business far removed from the cloistered groves of academe. It is only through decades of aggressive lobbying and legal battles that universities have managed to avoid income taxes on billions of dollars from broadcast rights, sponsorships and donations from boosters.So an escape hatch was opened for college sports. Over the years, the I.R.S. has periodically tried to close it. In the late 1970s, the agency looked at the relatively new stream of television revenue from college games and considered treating it as taxable unrelated business income. This ignited a spirited lobbying campaign by colleges and the N.C.A.A. until the I.R.S. retreated, declaring that selling tickets to fans who go to the school stadium was not all that different from broadcasting games to a television audience.Other attempts to tax college sports profits have been mostly rejected by lawmakers. In the 1990s, Congress did an end run around the I.R.S. and decreed that corporate sponsorships did not amount to advertising, which could be subject to the unrelated business income tax. It was not until the recently approved Republican tax plan that lawmakers reversed course, eliminating a partial deduction for booster donations tied to the sale of game tickets and imposing an excise tax on college employee salaries exceeding $1 million. Over all, however, most athletics revenue continues to flow tax-free.That means the college sports machine keeps cranking out expensive entertainment, and the scandals that go with it, while sheltered by the scholastic equivalent of a Cayman Islands tax dodge. If President Trump wants to repatriate and tax corporate profits stashed offshore, he might also consider the untaxed billions hiding in plain sight on campuses right here at home.AdvertisementCollapseSEE MY OPTIONS",Sports
